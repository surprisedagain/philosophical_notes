<div id="Leibnizs law"><h1 id="Leibnizs law" class="header"><a href="#Leibnizs law">Leibnizs law</a></h1></div>
<p>
According to Tarski, Leibniz's Law is the conjunction of both the
identity of indiscernibles and the indiscernability of identicals: <br>
</p>
<blockquote>
Among the logical laws concerning the concept of identity the most
fundamental is the following: x = y if, and only if, x has every property
which y has, and y has every property which x has.  This law was first
stated by Leibniz (although in somewhat different terms) and hence may be
called Leibniz' Law. (Introduction to Logic, 1941).
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Feldman (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2184291"><cite>Leibniz and "Leibniz' Law"</cite>, 1970</a>) Leibniz states
the principle of the identity of indiscernibles quite clearly in his
<em>Discourse on Metaphysics</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
&hellip; it is not true that two substances may be exactly alike and differ only
numerically, <em>solo numero</em> &hellip;
</blockquote>

<p>
One might naively have thought that the indiscernability of identicals was so
uncontroversial as to go without saying? This is, as one might expect, the topic
of scholarly debate. Some, such as Tarski above, interpreting Leibniz as
asserting the bi-conditional, while others interpret him as asserting only the
identity of indiscernibles.
</p>

<div id="Leibnizs law-principle of substitution"><h2 id="principle of substitution" class="header"><a href="#Leibnizs law-principle of substitution">principle of substitution</a></h2></div>
<p>
Leibniz also states something akin to a principle of substitution:
</p>
<blockquote>
Eadem sunt quorum unum in alterius locum substitui pote salva veritate<br>
(Gerhardt, <em>Die Philosophischen Schriften von G. W. Leibniz</em> Vol. VII)
</blockquote>
<p>
which has been translated as:
</p>
<blockquote>
Things are the same (or identical), one of which can be substituted in place
of the other with preservation of truth
</blockquote>

<p>
There is in this, no recognition of what Quine would call referentially opaque
(or non-extensional) contexts such as are created by modal operators and
(are generally thought to be created by) intentional idioms (believes, hopes,
etc.,). Furthermore it is not things themselves that are substituted
<em>salva veritate</em><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Quine explicitly attributes this phrase to Leibniz in S3 of <em>Two Dogmas</em>.</span></span> for each other but their names.  On this interpretation
(plausibly attributed to Quine) one must take Leibniz as careless of the
distinction between use and mention - between <q>Cicero</q> and Cicero.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2184291">Feldman</a> advances the theory that this is an identity criteria for concepts, such
as triangular and trilateral, quadrangle and quadrilateral. In this sense it
makes sense to say that two concepts are identical if their substitution for
each other (in the relevant judgement or whatever sentence-like entity it is
that concepts can compose) always leaves the truth of the judgement unchanged.
</p>

<p>
My suspicion, is that Leibniz is simply careless of the distinction. Treating
<q>Cicero</q>, Cicero and concepts all as objects. The confusion made
especially attractive that each object has a proper name
(<em>characteristica universalis</em> ???? this is the name of the language)
</p>

<p>
Is an object simply its object concept. The echo of this monad in that monad
over there?
</p>

<div id="Leibnizs law-identification of indiscernibles"><h2 id="identification of indiscernibles" class="header"><a href="#Leibnizs law-identification of indiscernibles">identification of indiscernibles</a></h2></div>
<p>
Quine inverts this with his identification of indiscernibles:
</p>
<blockquote>
Suppose a discourse about person stages, and suppose that whatever is said
about any person stage, in this particular discourse, applies equally to all
person stages which make the same amount of money. Our discourse is
simplified, then, by shifting its subject matter from person stages to
income groups. Distinctions immaterial to the discourse at hand are thus ex-
truded from the subject matter.<br>
In general we might propound this maxim of the identification of
indiscernibles: Objects indistinguishable from one another within the terms
of a given discourse should be construed as identical for that discourse.
More accurately: the references to the original objects should be
reconstrued for purppses of the discourse as referring to other and fewer
objects, in such a way that indistinguishable originals give way each to the
same new object.<br>
(<a href="../zz.texts/quine1961-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf">quine1961-fromALogicalPointOfView.pdf</a>)
</blockquote>
    
<p>
This reflects Quine's idea that for any discourse/language/theory/formal system
with a finite stock of predicates and the standard logical apparatus we can
define identity as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
x = y .def=. A(x) &harr; A(y) and B(x) &harr; B(y) &hellip; <br>
(source???? methods of logic? selected logic papers?)
</blockquote>

<p>
This is deeply appealing. It is we that divide up the world into objects. Though
there is no way to describe the world without doing so. That division is
intimately connected with the predicates we take to be true of those objects. Of
course, how else could it be?
