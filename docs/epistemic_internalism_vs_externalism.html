Alvin Plantinga is perhaps the best known proponent of epistemic externalism.
In his paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-9493-5_1"><cite>What is justified Belief?</cite></a> (1979) he claimed that:
</p>
<blockquote>
If S’s believing p at t results from a reliable cognitive belief-forming
process (or set of processes), then S’s belief in p at t is justified.
</blockquote>

<p>
It is worth mentioning that Plantinga has an ulterior motive for this view.
Trying to present an account in which <em>belief in God</em> is both rational (or at
least not irrational) and fundamental/basic(/not based upon evidence?). A
sophisticated(/weird) defence of Christianity that is driving much of
Plantinga's efforts, <em>not</em> a hyper scientific commitment to naturalism.

<p>
A solid refutation of Plantinga's externalism is given in
<a href="putnam1982-whyReasonCantBeNaturalized.html">putnam1982-whyReasonCantBeNaturalized</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
suppose that Tibetan Buddhism is, in fact, true, and that the Dalai Lama is,
in fact, infallible on matters of faith and morals. Anyone who believes in
the Dalai Lama, and who invariably believes any statement the Dalai Lama
makes on a matter of faith or morals, follows a method which is 100%
reliable; thus, if the reliability theory of rationality were correct, such
a person's beliefs on faith and morals would all be rational even if his
argument for his belief that the Dalai Lama is never wrong is "the Dalai
Lama says so".<br>
(fp. 5)
</blockquote>
<p>
This suggests, by omission if nothing else, that a knower must be able to
provide some kind of reasons (i.e. justification) for their beliefs if they are
to count as knowledge.
</p>

<div id="main-internalism"><h2 id="internalism" class="header"><a href="#main-internalism">internalism</a></h2></div>
<p>
An access condition to the justification of the belief is added in order for
that belief to count as knowledge.
