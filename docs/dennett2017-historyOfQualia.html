Dennett's paper does not bear up well under close consideration. As part of a
broader campaign of arguing against the existence of qualia, Dennett proposes a
variety of explanations for why people believe in them despite their
non-existence.  Unfortunately both his arguments and his explanations concern
the existence of phenomenal objects possessing the properties of the external
objects they represent (i.e. the truth of Aristotelian and Cartesian theories of
perception) rather than the existence of causally inert qualia.

<p>
One of the obstacles to understanding <em>A History of Qualia</em> (Dennett, 2017) is
its extraordinarily misleading title. For Dennett's paper is not about the
history of qualia, nor even the history of belief in qualia.  Instead it is
primarily a series of attempts to explain why people believe claims like the
following:
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td>
<span id="reply-a history of a solution to the hard problem of consciousness-(A) When you open your eyes and see something red, something red pops into existence in your mind/consciousness/awareness."></span><strong id="(A) When you open your eyes and see something red, something red pops into existence in your mind/consciousness/awareness.">(A) When you open your eyes and see something red, something red pops into existence in your mind/consciousness/awareness.</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
In Dennett's words:
</p>
<blockquote>
If you believe that your belief that there is a red apple in front
of you is <em>proximally</em> caused by a <q>phenomenal</q> red apple-representation
produced by your visual system to be the immediate source of your belief
you may well be mistaken. (I am sure you are, but it is my goal in this
paper to show you that I might be right, &hellip;)<br>
(fp. 3.a)
</blockquote>

<p>
Dennett is <em>not</em> arguing against the existence of qualia, but against
<span id="reply-a history of a solution to the hard problem of consciousness-Cartesian Theatre"></span><strong id="Cartesian Theatre">Cartesian Theatre</strong> accounts of perception. Theories according to which
the perception of external physical objects involves the perception of internal
phenomenal objects upon a private mental stage. The key claim of qualia
theories, by contrast, is that there is a way that having experiences <em>feels</em> over
and above the causal role of such experiences (or the phenomenal objects they are
experiences of). At least since Chalmers popularised the notion of
<a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a> in his book <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8qd06x64"><cite>The Conscious Mind</cite></a> (1996)
philosophers have generally used the term <q>qualia</q> to denote the supposed
non-causal qualities of conscious experience, rather than the causally effective
phenomena with which Dennett is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Some of the considerations Dennett raises do undercut key, if naive, reasons for
believing Cartesian theatre theories of perception (which are, after all, pretty
naive theories). Furthermore, those considerations do go some way towards
explaining why people might mistakenly believe such theories to be true.
However, the truth of Cartesian theatre theories of perception is only
tangentially related to the existence of <em>qualia</em>.
</p>

<div id="reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects"><h2 id="a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects" class="header"><a href="#reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects">a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects</a></h2></div>
<p>
Dennett begins by pointing out that a bad argument for (<span id="reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects-A"></span><strong id="A">A</strong>) (and, more
broadly, for Cartesian theatre theories of perception) is indeed very bad. The
argument he points out is very bad; well known enough to feature in the Stanford
Encyclopedia entry <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2021/entries/perception-problem#ArgIll"><cite>The Problem of Perception</cite></a><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Though the citations of the argument's chief proponents date from 1923, 1932 and 1952, and it is unclear if the argument has many recent proponents</span></span>; and may also go some way
towards explaining why people believe in phenomenal objects despite there not
being any. So Dennett may well be performing a useful service by pointing out
just how bad it is. But the argument in question is <em>not</em> a very bad argument
<em>for the existence of qualia</em>.
</p>

<p>
Paraphrasing from the Stanford Encyclopedia <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2021/entries/perception-problem">entry</a>, the very bad argument goes
roughly as follows:
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td>
P1: When someone perceives something to have a sensible quality, there is something with that quality that they directly perceive.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
P2: In an illusion, someone perceives something to have a sensible quality, which the ordinary object supposedly being perceived does not have.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
P3: Perceivers are directly aware of the same types of object when their perceptions are veridical as when they are illusory.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Conclusion: What perceivers directly perceive are phenomenal (or at least non-physical) objects with the sensible properties that they perceive.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
Dennett's chief criticism is that (<span id="reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects-P1"></span><strong id="P1">P1</strong>) is false. He doesn't argue that (<span id="reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects-P1"></span><strong id="P1">P1</strong>)
is false, so much as point out that Sir Walter Raleigh believed there was a
golden city in South America without there being a golden city in South America,
that one can believe red things to be nearby without there being any nearby red
things; and then suggest that one can perceive red objects without there being
any perceived red objects. 
</p>

<p>
The most technical explanation of why (<span id="reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects-P1"></span><strong id="P1">P1</strong>) is mistakenly thought to be true
(dimly lurking in the background of Dennett's considerations of Sir Walter
Raleigh's attitudes towards El Dorado) is that people mistakenly take the
relationships of [believing that], [seeming to] and [perceiving] to be
<a href="extensional.html">extensional</a>. For example, people are prone to take the sentence <q>Mary seems red
to Jane.</q> as something that might be correctly translated into first order
logic as:
<table>
<tr>
<td>
seems_to(Jane, Mary, red)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
A formula in which, in particular, the second place is accessible to
existential generalisation. Thus they take the inference from that sentence to the
sentence <q>There is something that seems red to Jane</q> (which might be translated
into first order logic as):
<table>
<tr>
<td>
∃x seems_to(Jane, x, red)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
to be valid.
</p>

<p>
Of course, people don't, in general, have <em>any</em> opinions about how to translate
statements of ordinary English into first order logic; and claiming that the
verbs <q>believe</q>, <q>seem</q> and <q>perceive</q> give rise to non-<a href="extensional.html">extensional</a> contexts
doesn't explain <em>why</em> existential generalisation (and the interchange of
co-extensive terms) within those contexts doesn't always preserve truth.  Still,
a hint of an explanation as to why people might falsely believe (<span id="reply-a bad reason for believing in phenomenal objects-P1"></span><strong id="P1">P1</strong>) and its
ilk remains.  Those patterns of inference do preserve truth when applied to
many verbs such as <q>touch</q>, <q>have</q>, <q>give</q> etc., and people
mistakenly generalise from those cases to form the belief that those patterns of
inference also preserve truth in the case of verbs such as <q>perceive</q>.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if anyone actually does believe in <em>qualia</em> because they take
<q>perceives</q> to be extensional and hence believe that when someone perceives
pink elephants there must be perceived pink elephants, but if they do it seems
to me they oughtn't. I take it that qualia theorists claim that there is more to
life/the world than is described in our scientific theories. Qualia are supposed
to be a reason for rejecting naturalism. The hard problem of consciousness is
supposed to be that one can have any range of natural/causal properties and
still not experience anything (i.e. be a <a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical zombie</a>). Qualia
theorists claim that this lack is a lack of qualia. On their view we are
philosophical zombies plus qualia. But, despite the plural (-ia) this does not
require the aspects of consciousness that are missing from our scientific
theories to be phenomenal objects.
</p>

<p>
The claim that there is something it feels like to see pink elephants does not
imply that seeing pink elephants involves the presentation to consciousness of
phenomenal pink elephants.  This is perhaps exemplified in the greatest
technical detail in Carnap's <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gqkbn48vn"><cite>Aufbau</cite></a>. The fundamental experiences denoted
by the basic terms from which Carnap proposed to logically construct talk of all
other objects, were irreducibly gestalt total experiences.  They stood to each
other in relations of part-identity and part-similarity but were not themselves
composed of phenomenal entities (or indeed of anything). In Carnap's system,
coloured sections of the visual field, for instance, are treated as classes of
gestalt experiences (those which we may afterwards identify as being coloured
alike in that section). Carnap intended this to eliminate, in the final
analysis, phenomenal objects other than the gestalt experiences altogether. For
he claimed that <q>The "class" is not, properly speaking, an object. Its symbol
merely serves to make those assertions which hold equally for all its
elements</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/s2gqkbn48vn">carnap1926-derAufbauDerWelt.pdf</a></span></span>. We may be unconvinced that ontological commitments to classes can
be so trivially dispensed with. We may also remain unsure if the postulation of
some kind of experiential/phenomenological entities is indispensable to our talk
of psychological states. But although Carnap's system postulates the existence
of phenomenal objects in the form of gestalt experiences (and perhaps classes of
them) it does not postulate the existence of phenomenological pink elephants
whenever pink elephants are seen. Despite this, a Carnapian proponent of qualia
might still insist that there is <q>a way it feels</q> to have certain
experiences. Something additional to the various causal roles such experiences
may fulfill, and hence indetectable by third person scientific investigation.
</p>

<p>
More broadly, a qualia theorist may insist that there is more to consciousness
than is described in our scientific theories without claiming that there are
phenomenal objects. They might instead, for example, hold that
experiences are states of consciousness, properties of such states, or processes
involving them. So long as they maintain that these are states of
consciousness, and there is something it feels like to be in those states
(a feeling lacked by <a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a> and omitted from our scientific
theories) they are, at least by my lenient standards, qualia theorists.
</p>

<p>
Dennett is completely correct that people can see red things without there being
any red things they see (but not without there being representations of red
things); and believe in the existence of golden cities without believed in
golden cities existing (but not without representations of golden cities
existing).  However, to infer from this that there are no qualia, is rather like
inferring that no-one can do anything for the sake of love from the (perfectly
true) claim that there are no such things as sakes.

<div id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects"><h2 id="qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects" class="header"><a href="#reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects">qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects</a></h2></div>
<p>
The second explanation Dennett offers for peoples' erroneous belief in (<span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-A"></span><strong id="A">A</strong>) is
that they confuse properties of the intentional objects of their beliefs
with properties of the proximal causes of those beliefs:
</p>
<blockquote>
It sure seems that when one hallucinates a red apple, this must
involve the real existence (in some “dimension” or “arena” that might not be
physical) of something that is (in some perhaps special, subjective sense)
red and round, an object created in the mind by whatever it is that creates
hallucinations. It is that object, that phenomenon that one is talking about
when one talks about the contents of one’s conscious experience. I am
insisting that this is a mistake, not the indubitable deliverance of
introspection and reflection. What you are doing when you make this mistake
is confusing the intentional object of your belief with the proximal cause
of your belief.<br>
(fp. 2.b)
</blockquote>
<p>
i.e. People believe (<span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-A"></span><strong id="A">A</strong>) because they confuse the properties that neural firing
patterns/mechanisms/dispositions <em>represent</em> external objects as possessing,
with the properties of the proximal (more or less neural) <em>causes</em> of beliefs
that those representations are true:
</p>
<blockquote>
An example: I invite you to imagine a bright blue capital “A”
against a black background, and you comply. I tell you that the “A” you then
tell me about—it’s in a serif font, and the blue is October-sky blue, not
baby blue—is actually no more blue than its representation in this Word file
is blue.<br>
(fp. 4.a) 
</blockquote>
<p>
Like the representation in the Word file, the <q>internal neural representation
of the capital A</q> <em>represents</em> something blue but is not itself blue, nor was
the proximal cause of its existence something blue. (Dennett equivocates as to
whether it is the properties of neural representations or of their causes that
people are confused about.)
</p>

<div id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties"><h3 id="qualia are not natural properties" class="header"><a href="#reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties">qualia are not natural properties</a></h3></div>
<p>
It is odd that Dennett accuses those who believe in qualia of confusing the
properties of the objects presented to consciousness with the properties those
presentations represent external objects as possessing. Belief in qualia is, at
least in part, a belief that something is going on in consciousness (whether it
involves properties, objects, processes or whatever) that is utterly unlike the
properties of unconscious physical objects.
</p>

<p>
Even believers in both qualia and Cartesian theatre models of perception need
not make the confusion that Dennett attributes to them. This point may be made
more vivid by speaking in the voice of such a believer for the next two
paragraphs:
</p>

<p>
<span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties-Cartesian Theatre Theorist"></span><strong id="Cartesian Theatre Theorist">Cartesian Theatre Theorist</strong>: Of course the sensation of red in your mind, does
not realise the same color property possessed by British postboxes and Chinese
new-year lanterns.  The color possessed by postboxes and lanterns is a matter of
light reflectance/emission, their tendency to <em>cause</em> certain types of
sensations/phenomena.  (What Dennett quite reasonably calls an affordance.) Our
minds/brains/sensory nerves do a lot of computation that we are unaware of to
represent the reflectance of such objects as unvarying under different
illumination and occasionally this complex calculation goes wrong (or at least
diverges wildly from individual; to individual - see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_dress&amp;oldid=1231366313">gold/blue dress</a>); but to the extent that it produces fairly consistent results
over a range of illumination and other background conditions, we can call
external objects red. (And if we feel the need, designate the conditions under
which red things cause red sensations as <q>normal conditions</q>.)
</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, Dennett is correct, it is an error to call both phenomenal
objects and the external objects that cause (and are represented by) those
phenomena <q>red</q>.  But it is a harmless matter, akin to what Quine calls
<q>deferred ostention</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="../../../../../../../../../zz.texts/quine1969-ontologicalRelativityAOE.pdf">Ontological Relativity</a></span></span>.  It is the sense in which the controller of a train
network might call a certain type of train green because trains of that type
reliably <em>cause</em> (and are represented by) green lights on her indicator board.
(One controller might say to another <q>There's a green train northbound on the
H line</q>  and be perfectly understood.) The green light on the indicator board
does not possess the property of the trains that reliably <em>cause</em> green lights
to light up on the indicator board (that might might be, for instance, drawing a
certain amperage, or having a weight within a certain range); and the train it
represents, we may suppose, is not itself green. So too red sensations do not
possess the electro/physico/chemical properties possessed by red apples which
more or less reliably <em>cause</em> (miscalled) red sensations when viewed under more
or less normal conditions.<br>
<span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties-End Cartesian Theatre Theorist"></span><strong id="End Cartesian Theatre Theorist">End Cartesian Theatre Theorist</strong>
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to guarantee that no-one has ever adopted a Cartesian theatre
account of perception because they confused the properties of external objects
with the properties of the mental entities that represent them. But belief in
such theories does not require such confusion, and clarification of this
confusion does not require such theories to be abandoned.  According to
Cartesian theater accounts of perception, the properties of phenomenal objects
and the properties of external objects are linked by representational and causal
relationships, but they need not be <em>identical</em>.
</p>

<p>
It is true that according to the even older <span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties-Aristotelian"></span><strong id="Aristotelian">Aristotelian</strong> accounts of perception,
the properties of our sensations were supposed to be identical with the
properties of external objects that they represented
(see <a href="../01.reasonLanguageNecessity/collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#second problem: the content of scientific theories">wn.rLN:collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning#second problem: the content of scientific theories</a>).
But this was no careless confusion between the proximal and distal causes of
belief. It was a key part part of the Aristotelian explanation of our knowledge
of necessary truths. According to Aristotelian epistemology it is <em>because</em> our
sensations impress the properties of external objects into our minds as concepts
that we are able to discern the modal relationships between those properties.
</p>

<p>
Although the ancient Aristotelian view had a lingering influence on the
proponents of Cartesian theatre accounts of perception (particularly on their
accounts of our knowledge of modal truths) there was a key difference.
Proponents of Cartesian theatre accounts of perception distinguished between
<span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties-primary"></span><strong id="primary">primary</strong> and <span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties-secondary"></span><strong id="secondary">secondary</strong> properties. <span id="reply-qualia as natural properties of phenomenal objects-qualia are not natural properties-Primary"></span><strong id="Primary">Primary</strong> properties were possessed by
both external objects and their phenomenal representations<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">if they had any</span></span>,
while secondary properties were merely phenomenal. As Galileo put it at the
very beginning of the development of Cartesian theories of perception:
</p>
<blockquote>
from the point of view of the subject in which they seem to inhere, these
tastes, odors, colors, etc., are nothing but empty names; rather they inhere
only in the sensitive body, such that if one removes the animal, then all
these qualities are taken away and annihilated.<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assayer"><cite>The Assayer</cite></a>, 1623)
</blockquote>
<p>
Secondary properties represented hodgepodge constellations of
external properties that were only bound together by their common disposition to
<em>cause</em> phenomena possessing a particular secondary property when observed by
humans and other animals (under <q>normal</q> circumstances). The distinction between
primary and secondary properties was the key difference between Aristotelian and
Cartesian accounts of perception, and marked the first attempt at modifying
Aristotelian accounts of perception to fit with modern scientific
discoveries concerning the physiology of perception (see <a href="../01.reasonLanguageNecessity/collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning.html#new understanding of the physiological processes of perception">wn.rLN:collapse_of_traditional_European_accounts_of_reasoning#new understanding of the physiological processes of perception</a>).
</p>

<p>
In any case, if believers in Cartesian theatres <em>need not</em> make the confusion
Dennett accuses them of (i.e. need not confuse phenomenal properties with the
external properties they represent/are caused by) believers in qualia <em>cannot</em>
make this confusion, or at least not without contradicting themselves. Unlike
Cartesian phenomena, qualia cannot be causes. Qualia are, supposedly, causally
inert. Their presence cannot be detected by their causal effects, and as a
result they are omitted from the scientific image of the world. By contrast, the
properties we perceive external objects to possess such as size, shape, colour
etc., are causally efficacious elements of the scientific image of the world
(otherwise we could not perceive them). It is essential for qualia theories to
distinguish between the two.  Hence Dennett's explanation of belief in
<em>qualia</em> as due to a confusion between the qualities of the proximal causes of
belief (neurological mechanisms according to Dennett, phenomena according to
proponents of Cartesian theatres) and the distal causes those beliefs are about,
is simply misplaced.  The confusion not only fails to explain peoples' belief in
qualia, it is outright inconsistent with such belief.
</p>

<div id="reply-belief in phenomena can do the heavy (causal) lifting"><h2 id="belief in phenomena can do the heavy (causal) lifting" class="header"><a href="#reply-belief in phenomena can do the heavy (causal) lifting">belief in phenomena can do the heavy (causal) lifting</a></h2></div>
<p>
Dennett appears to offer a third and final explanation for peoples' false belief
in phenomenal objects:
</p>
<blockquote>
Qualia are the intentional objects of many of the reflective or
introspective beliefs that one may have about one’s own mental states. What
could be more obvious? In that tone of voice, talking about intentional
objects, it is clear that people do think about, talk about, wonder about,
delight in, &hellip; their qualia. It is just as undeniable a fact as the fact
that Sir Walter Raleigh was searching for El Dorado. What is not obvious is
that qualia are real, that qualia exist.
(fp. 3.b)
</blockquote>
<p>
<p class="smallnote"> The <q>tone of voice</q> involved is that in which one speaks of non-existent
intentional objects as real. The tone of voice in which, for instance, atheists
write books titled <q>A History of God</q>, and deniers of qualia write papers
titled <q>A History of Qualia</q>. </p>
</p>

<p>
Superficially this may be taken for an explanation of people's belief in qualia
that combines elements from Dennett's previous explanations. At first glance it
appears to be like those previous explanations in attributing people's false
beliefs in the existence of qualia to confusion between objects (in this case
qualia) and their representations.  But a moment's reflection reveals that it is
not an explanation of people's false belief in qualia at all. <em>Any</em> false belief
that an object exists will have that object as its non-existent intentional
object, regardless of <em>why</em> that belief is held. Dennett's claim that qualia are
the non-existent intentional objects of people's beliefs about their own mental
states is simply a fancy way of saying that people falsely believe they have
qualia, and <em>not</em> an explanation of why they have that false belief.
</p>

<p>
Still, there is a kind of explanation on offer here, just not of peoples'
belief in qualia. Dennett has slipped unannounced from explaining why people
falsely believe in qualia, to explaining peoples' <em>behaviour</em> without
postulating the existence of qualia. Dennett is offering to explain how it is
that people talk about, pursue etc., qualia <em>without there being any qualia</em>.
The explanation is that people <em>believe</em> they have qualia and these beliefs
cause them to talk of, pursue, delight in etc., qualia in the same way that
Raleigh sought after El Dorado:
</p>
<blockquote>
They [qualia realists] are like the (one presumes imaginary)
critics of Sir Walter Raleigh who could manage to marvel at how Raleigh
could ever be driven to such lengths by something—El Dorado—that didn’t even
exist<br>
(fp. 6.b)
</blockquote>
<p>
The point being that El Dorado doesn't need to exist in order to explain
Raleigh's incredible efforts to find it, Raleigh's behaviour can be explained
(in part) by his mere <em>belief</em> in El Dorado. So too, Dennett suggests, we don't
need qualia but only the belief in qualia to explain peoples' behaviour.
</p>

<p>
According to Dennett the causal role supposedly played by qualia is, in fact,
played by our beliefs and our neural representations of both external objects
other mental states.  It is not the glorious blue of the qualia created by my
contemplation of the guard's cloak in the painting that causes me to focus my
attention on that part of the painting, instead it is the <q>triggers that
initiate positive affective responses, dispositions to wax poetical</q> etc.,
that my neural representation of the blue cloak <q>comes equipped with</q>.
And it is my (false) belief that I have qualia that causes me to (mistakenly)
ascribe my continued attention to that part of the painting to the glorious
qualia I mistakenly believe I am experiencing.
</p>

<p>
As in the other explanations Dennett offers in this paper, the chief problem
arises from his use of the term <q>qualia</q> to denote causally efficacious
phenomena rather than causally inefficacious qualia. Since this is the key
confusion that underlies this paper it we shall treat it directly and explicitly
in the conclusion.
</p>

<div id="reply-conclusion"><h2 id="conclusion" class="header"><a href="#reply-conclusion">conclusion</a></h2></div>
<p>
The criticisms raised in this commentary all hinge upon Dennett's use of the
term <q>qualia</q> to denote causally efficacious phenomena rather than causally
inefficacious qualia. At first glance, this may seem to be a merely
terminological issue, a case of disputants simply talking
past each another because they attach different meanings to the same
term<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">Meaning free paraphrase: Taking a dispute to be substantive when it can be resolved by non-homophonic translation</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
<q>Qualia</q> is a term of art, unanchored by common usage, and hence
particularly susceptible to being used in different senses by different
philosophers.  Dennett is likely not alone in using <q>qualia</q> the way he
does (he certainly describes Nicholas Humphrey, the main target of his
criticisms, as using the term in the same sense) but even if he were alone, why
would it matter? If one insists upon restricting the term <q>qualia</q> to apply
only to causally inert qualities of conscious experience, while Dennett uses the
term <q>qualia</q> to denote the causally efficacious mental entities that
others denote by the term <q>phenomena</q> why not simply abandon homophonic
translation and render his claims into one's preferred dialect by substituting
the term <q>phenomena</q> for <q>qualia</q>?  (Rendering, for instance, the
title of his paper as <em>A History of Phenomena</em>.)
</p>

<p>
The key obstacle to such a tolerant approach, is that Dennett presents himself
as engaging with the hard problem of consciousness:
</p>
<blockquote>
If they [qualia] are not real, they pose no more challenge to
Modern Science than Raleigh’s El Dorado. The Hard Problem (Chalmers 1995,
&zwj;1996) would turn out to be no problem at all, or rather, it would
disintegrate (as I have long urged) into a host of “easy” problems about how
people could be seduced into thinking that their qualia were real, &hellip;<br>
(fp. 3.b)
</blockquote>

<p>
Another, comparatively minor, though related way in which the title of Dennett's
paper is misleading, is that it contains very little about the history of
qualia, why the term was invented and why their existence became a hot topic in
late 20th century philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Qualia and philosophical zombies both came to the attention of late 20th century
philosophers because they appeared to present a problem for a promising approach
to developing a naturalistic account of mental states. The most influential
proponents of such accounts included David Armstrong<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">_A Materialist Theory of the Mind</span></span>, Fodor<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">psychosemantics????, one of his papers on identification</span></span> and David Lewis.
The most sophisticated and technically precise sketches of how such an
account might be developed were presented in Lewis's justly famous papers
<em>How to define theoretical terms</em> (1970) and <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048407212341301"><cite>Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications</cite></a>
(1972).
</p>

<p>
According to the increasingly sophisticated versions of such accounts, mental
states(/objects/processes) could be identified by their <span id="reply-conclusion-a little history of qualia and the hard problem of consciousness-causal role"></span><strong id="causal role">causal role</strong> in
creatures' mental lives. (In the more behaviouristic versions of
these theories this was taken to be the causal role they played in mediating
between creatures publicly observable stimuli and publicly observable behaviour.)
This would allow the construction of what was, at least in effect, a definite
description true of just the entity playing that role in a particular creature's
life. A definite description which further empirical investigation might reveal
to be a physical (or at least natural) structure in that creature's brain/body.
The argument, as David Lewis succinctly put it, went as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
Mental state M = the occupant of causal role R (by definition of M).<br>
Neural state N = the occupant of causal role R (by the physiological theory).<br>
∴ Mental state M = neural state N (by transitivity of =).<br>
(<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048407212341301"><cite>Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications</cite></a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
Qualia were invoked as counter-examples to such analyses of mental state
attributions. According to their proponents, qualia couldn't be identified with
physical structures having particular causal roles because they *had no causal
roles at all*. A qualia was an aspect or quality of conscious experience that
philosophical zombies lacked <span id="reply-conclusion-a little history of qualia and the hard problem of consciousness-even though they had physical structures"></span><strong id="even though they had physical structures">even though they had physical structures</strong> *playing
all the appropriate causal roles* (whatever they might turn out to be).  If
there were qualia, and philosophical zombies were possible, i.e. If:
</p>
<blockquote>
it is at least logically possible for there to be an organism
indistinguishable from a normal human being in all anatomical, behavioural
and other observable respects, yet insentient.<br>
(Robert Kirk, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/LXXXIII.329.43"><cite>Sentience and Behaviour</cite></a> , 1974)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
&hellip; then certain widely held views about the analysis of reports of
experience must be abandoned, and it is hard to see how Materialism can
survive. But if it can be shown to be invalid, then it seems that
Materialism is almost home and dry.<br>
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/LXXXIII.329.43"><cite>ibid.</cite></a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
A belief, desire or thought may be <q>by definition</q> a state, property or
process playing a certain causal role in the etiology of someone's behaviour and
therefore identified with whichever neuro/physiological structure plays
the role.  However, the proponents of qualia claimed that there were 
<b>qual</b>ities of conscious experience that could not be identified by their
causal role because it was conceivable (and hence possible) for there to be
creatures whose innards played all those causal roles, but who yet lacked those
<b>qual</b>ities of conscious experience. 
</p>

<p>
Thus Dennett's claim that <q>The philosophers’ concept of qualia is an artifact
of bad theorizing, and in particular, of failing to appreciate the distinction
between the intentional object of a belief (for instance) and the cause(s) of
that belief.</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">fp. 1.Abstract</span></span> is simply mistaken. Of course, <em>some</em> philosophers may have
used the term <q>qualia</q> to express the concept Dennett describes, but that
is <em>not</em> the sense in which qualia came to be widely discussed in the
philosophical community towards the end of the 20th century.
</p>

<div id="reply-conclusion-Dennett's rejection of qualia"><h3 id="Dennett's rejection of qualia" class="header"><a href="#reply-conclusion-Dennett's rejection of qualia">Dennett's rejection of qualia</a></h3></div>
<p>
Dennett's mistaken belief that the hard problem of consciousness will
<q>disintegrate</q> into a cluster of easy problems concerning the causes of
people's beliefs, is the result of his confusion between causally efficacious
phenomena (featuring in Cartesian theatre accounts of perception) and causally
inefficacious qualia (which are conspicuous by their absence in
<a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a>).
</p>

<p>
Much as La Place famously dismissed the existence of God on the grounds that he
<q>had no need of that hypothesis</q>, Dennett dismisses qualia on the
grounds that <q>there is no role for a substitute real object, an inner real
object that “has all the same properties” to be among the more proximal causes
of [a] mental state</q>. Our physiological understanding of
the processes mediating between stimuli and behaviour is still at an early
stage, but the results already established leave no scope for the causal
influence of non-physical phenomena. While we have only the vaguest preliminary
understanding of how our brains implement beliefs and desires, as far as we can
tell thus far, every event we are able to detect in people's brains, every
neuron firing, release of hormones or alteration in the strength of a synaptic
connection, occurs as a result of purely physical causes.  If there were
non-physical causal influences anything like those described in Cartesian and
Aristotelian accounts of perception we would have seen their effects by now, but
no variation from what we would expect of a purely physical system has yet been
observed.
</p>

<p>
Taken as applying to phenomena, Dennett's objection is good. The failure to
observe their expected effects is a good (though defeasible) reason to deny the
existence of causally efficacious entities such as God and phenomena. But it is
not a reason to deny the existence of causally inefficacious entities such
as qualia (and numbers). The theories in which such qualities of conscious
experience are attributed to various organisms (or their sensations) do not
predict that those qualities have any causal effects, and hence they are not
infirmed by our failure to observe such effects. Applied to <em>qualia</em> Dennett's 
argument becomes: We are justified in believing there aren't any causally
inefficacious aspects of consciousness because we haven't observed their
causal effects.
</p>

<p>
But if Dennett's argument is <em>not</em> taken as applying to qualia then it
simply fails to engage with the Hard problem of consciousness at all.
What is supposed to make the hard problem of consciousness so hard, and is the
point behind the postulation of qualia, is that the totality of someones
behaviour <span id="reply-conclusion-Dennett's rejection of qualia-can"></span><strong id="can">can</strong> be causally explained <q>at every level that is useful</q><span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">fp. 3.b</span></span>
without the attribution of conscious experiences (i.e. things that are or
possess qualia) <span id="reply-conclusion-Dennett's rejection of qualia-and yet we have them"></span><strong id="and yet we have them">and yet we have them</strong>. The physical/neurological explanations
of behaviour that Dennett hopes will be revealed by empirical investigation
of our brains and bodies, apply just as well to <a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a> as
they do to us. Hence, they neither explain why we have qualia, nor
give us reason to doubt that we do.
</p>

<p>
As Chalmers pointed out in <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8qd06x64"><cite>The Conscious Mind</cite></a> (which Dennett cited):
</p>
<blockquote>
consciousness is not an explanatory construct, postulated to help explain
behavior or events in the world. Rather, it is a brute explanandum, a
phenomenon in its own right that is in need of explanation. It therefore
does not matter if it turns out that consciousness is not required to do any
work in explaining other phenomena. Our evidence for consciousness never lay
with these other phenomena in the first place. Even if our judgments about
consciousness are explained reductively, all this shows is that our
judgments can be explained reductively. The mind-body problem is not that of
explaining our judgments about consciousness. If it were, it would be a
relatively trivial problem. Rather, the mind-body problem is that of
explaining consciousness itself. If the judgments can be explained without
explaining consciousness, then that is interesting and perhaps surprising,
but it does not remove the mind-body problem.<br>
(<a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t8qd06x64">chalmers1996-consciousMind.pdf</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>
It is only by equivocating between the two senses of qualia<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">viz., causally inefficacious qualities of conscious experience and causally efficacious phenomena</span></span>
that Dennett appears to be both providing good reason to doubt the
existence of qualia <span id="reply-conclusion-Dennett's rejection of qualia-and"></span><strong id="and">and</strong> <q>disintegrating</q> the hard problem of
consciousness into a <q>into a host of 'easy' problems about how people could be
seduced into thinking that their qualia were real</q>. Here, at last, we have a
clear case of a false belief that can be causally explained as due to a
confusion between two types of objects. Dennett's mistaken belief that he is
involved in <q>disintegrating</q> the hard problem of consciousness is caused,
in part, by his confusion between qualia and phenomena. That, in turn, suggests
a title for this response: <q>A History of a Solution to the Hard Problem of
Consciousness</q>.

<div id="reply-cutting room floor"><h2 id="cutting room floor" class="header"><a href="#reply-cutting room floor">cutting room floor</a></h2></div>
<p>
The causal properties attributed to those
sensations/hallucinations/beliefs/mental states are realised by various neural
states.  Viewed as theoretical posits a la David Lewis, the question is whether
those patterns of neural firing etc., are close enough to realising our ordinary
theories of sensations to count as the referents of our terms. Are they, after
all, the objects our claims and beliefs about qualia refer to? 
</p>

<p>
Dennett, somewhat unhelpfully, says yes and no:
</p>
<div id="reply-cutting room floor-yes"><h4 id="yes" class="header"><a href="#reply-cutting room floor-yes">yes</a></h4></div>
<p>
In the <q>tendentious attitude &hellip; of the Freudian critic</q> (who insists that
a play's female protagonist is <em>really</em> the author's mother) we may identify the
neural pattern fulfilling those causal roles with qualia.
</p>


<p>
In this sense the entities that my beliefs about my own sensations/mental states
are about (their intentional objects as Dennett tends to put it)
are patterns of neural firing - the occupants of certain causal roles. And -
most importantly - one's beliefs about one's own sensations may be true!
</p>

<div id="reply-cutting room floor-no"><h4 id="no" class="header"><a href="#reply-cutting room floor-no">no</a></h4></div>
<p>
In the other sense, the sense in which my sensation of blue is a particularly
attractive(/hideous) shade of aqua-marine, it does not exist. The objects having
these sensory qualities are <em>merely</em> intentional.  <q>Sensations have qualia the
way El Dorado was made of gold.</q> i.e. our belief sensations exist and possess
the properties of being coloured, brassy etc., is false.
</p>

<p>
In this sense all our beliefs about qualia and the role they play in directing
our attention are false.
</p>

<p>
Our mind falsely represents the causes of our beliefs as phenomenal green patches, round
quale etc., when in fact they are patterns of neural firing (themselves caused
in large part by the stimulation of sensory receptor nerves). Normally (or at
least often) the identification of cause and intentional object, is successful,
the red apple both causes and is the intentional object of your belief that
there is an apple in front of you. In the case of beliefs about your own
sensations (and the causes of your beliefs) the intentional object of your
belief is a green/red/whatever patch and its cause is a pattern of neural firing
that is not green/red/whatever.

Lovely quote for naturalistic theories of belief formation/justification:
</p>
<blockquote>
Normally, if I believe there is a red apple on the table in front of me, my
belief is caused by a red apple in front of me. The apple exists, and is
red, and is the indirect, distal cause of my belief. (It causes events in my
eyes and visual cortex which cause me eventually to go into the mental state
of believing that there is a red apple in front of me.)

<p>
Here we get serious:
</p>
<blockquote>
It sure seems that when one hallucinates a red apple, this must involve the
real existence (in some “dimension” or “arena” that might not be physical)
of something that is (in some perhaps special, subjective sense) red and
round, an object created in the mind by whatever it is that creates
hallucinations. It is that object, that phenomenon that one is talking about
when one talks about the contents of one’s conscious experience. I am
insisting that this is a mistake, not the indubitable deliverance of
introspection and reflection. What you are doing when you make this mistake
is confusing the intentional object of your belief with the proximal cause
of your belief. You are <q>authoritative</q> about the intentional object of your
belief in the same way a novelist is authoritative about the characters in
her novel, but you have precious little access to, or knowledge about, the
proximal cause[s] of those beliefs.
</blockquote>

<p>
Is denying qualia simply to deny that <q>necessarily</q>/<q>always</q>/whenever
I see(/hallucinate) a red apple there is something red that I am seeing?
That is an unhelpfully legalistic interpretation of the claim that there are
qualia. 
</p>

<p>
Consider Nagel's <q>there is something it is like to be that organism</q>. Yes
this does put its existential quantifier up front:
</p>
<blockquote>
(∃_q_) <em>q</em> is what it is like to be that organism
</blockquote>
<p>
But that is, as one used to be blithely say, only its <em>superficial</em> logical
form, which is not not guaranteed to be its deep logical form.
</p>

<p>
It seems that here Dennett has focused on the technical/logical component of the
postulation of qualia - that qualia are objects.  But the claim that qualia are
objects is the least significant element of the claim that there are qualia.
</p>

<p>
<p class="smallnote">The remainder of this section is largely quoted in the summary above.</p>
</p>

<p>
The qualia theorist claims that there is more to life/the world than is
described in our scientific theories. Qualia are supposed to be a reason for
rejecting naturalism. The hard problem of consciousness is supposed to be that
one can have all those natural physical properties and still not experience
anything (be a philosophical zombie). The qualia theorist claims that this lack
is, at least in part (but usually solely) a lack of qualia, we are philosophical
zombies plus qualia. But, despite the plural (-ia) this does not mean that the
qualia theorist is committed to there being <span id="notes on first reading-1 what are intensional objects (made of)-qualia objects that possess erroneously sensed properties-things"></span><strong id="things">things</strong> that are not denoted in our
scientific theories.
</p>

<p>
Qualia may be properties or states. The property of perceiving red, states of
whole minds/brains, or of some component or other (a genuine object) in our
minds. Unnatural properties, in the sense that ascriptions of them don't occur
in our scientific theories (or at least not those other than psychology) but
properties (rather than things) all the same.
</p>

<p>
If your only reason for believing in qualia was that you thought that whenever
people see red, there must be red things that they see, then Dennett's
observations would indeed be devastating. Dennett is right that one can see pink
elephants without there being pink elephants to see (not even mental ones).
</p>

<p>
But that seems to be a very uncommon (and obviously implausible) reason for
believing in qualia.  A qualia theorist may be perfectly happy if they can show
that there are things (conscious minds) that have the property of experiencing
qualia, without qualia being things.
</p>

<p>
It is as if someone concluded that no-one could do anything for the sake of
love(/whatever) because there are no such things as sakes.

<p>
This is the New Yorker cover Dennett mentions: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1969/10/18">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1969/10/18</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
(fp. 3-4) Here is where the footing gets slippery. In order for these
internal behaviors, these things happening in the brain, to occupy this
status of accessibility, they must be the reliable causes, shapers,
modulators of the beliefs he expresses when he tells us what it’s like to be
him at this time.  But these internal things are not to be identified with
the intentional objects of those beliefs since the intentional objects of
those beliefs may be fictions, as unreal as Santa Claus (who is not the
cause of anybody’s beliefs about Santa Claus, by virtue of having the
debilitating property of non-existence)
</blockquote>
<p>
Does the tacit argument for the <q>reliable causes</q> claim go: in order to be
accessible we (each person) must have knowledge of them, in order to have
knowledge of them they have to be reliable causes of those beliefs. i.e. Dennett
is here relying on the externalist reliable cause account of
justification/knowledge? Does rejecting reliablism change the plausibility of
his claim? I suspect not, but hmm, ????
</p>

<p>
So Dennett's claim is that the accessible things happening inside someones mind
are neural states of their brain (note neural states are not thing but ways
things [i.e. neural networks] can be) and it is they that cause the various
beliefs I am now seeing a red apple, I am thinking of a blue letter <q>A</q> and
so on. These neural states are <span id="notes on first reading-2 Where are the qualia-not"></span><strong id="not">not</strong> the intensional objects of those beliefs
</p>

<p>
Consider my claim: <q>I am seeing a red apple that is wider than it is tall</q>. It
seems that this may be true - indeed that my opinion about the matter is
<q>authoritative</q> (as Dennett puts it). Now the cause of my belief is not
something wider than it is tall, it is presumably some neural state about whose
dimensions I may not have any beliefs. So what is the object I believe to be
wider than it is tall?
</p>

<p>
Is my belief that I am seeing an apple that is wider then tall false if I am
hallucinating the apple? That there is no apple (pace no Santa) and hence all my
beliefs about it are false? But what of the belief that I am seeing an apple.
That is true but its truth requires no apple, mental(/quale) or physical.
</p>

<p>
The <em>intentional object</em> of my belief is an apple, but that, one supposes is no
kind of apple at all. One might hallucinate apples and yet there be no apples of
any kind in your world.
</p>

<p>
In cases of error/hallucination the intensional object of my beliefs is not the
cause of my beliefs. Santa is not the(/a) cause of my belief in Santa, there is
no red apple that is causing my belief that I am seeing a red apple. My belief
there is a red apple is caused by some neural state/
</p>

<p>
It seems that what does the work here is the shift from intentional objects to
mental/neural states. But this just reinforces the suggestion that what is
giving rise to Dennett's issues is the postulation of mental objects and
the claim that those mental objects actually possess the properties we
perceive them as having - red hallucinated apples, cheery Santa Claus and so on.
The issue is the postulation of these objects. See previous section.

<p>
It took a second time through to work out that the chief claim is that qualia
are the intentional objects of beliefs about our own mental states.
</p>

<p>
We believe that it is a <q>glorious, life-affirming, glowing, heart-breakingly
lovely subjective patch of blue</q> that causes our <q>positive affective
response</q> disposition to wax poetical and so on, when in fact it is a
<q>impersonal boring pattern of neural firing</q> that comes equipped with
triggers for initiating those affective responses and so on.
</p>

<p>
Our beliefs are about the latter (pattern of neural firing). But we mistakenly
believe that these things appear to us certain ways. <q>sensations have qualia
the way that El Dorado was made of gold.</q>

<p>
From here on in it is useful to use the thought experiment/intuition pump/? of
philosophical zombies. We need not take them as possible, but Dennett's next few
attacks can be made vivid as properties/aspects that <a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a> must
still have if they exist at all. The qualia become so thin, consciousness so
rarified, that it is increasingly implausible that there is anything left of
them.
</p>

<div id="notes on first reading-3 Nicholas Humphrey's inventions-consciousness an illusion"><h5 id="consciousness an illusion" class="header"><a href="#notes on first reading-3 Nicholas Humphrey's inventions-consciousness an illusion">consciousness an illusion</a></h5></div>
<p>
Here we have a seemingly altogether different line of attack. Now the criticism
is of the notion of consciousness which is rejected as <q>a user-illusion</q>.
That seems problematic, since for there be an illusion there needs to be a clash
between appearance and reality. A visual illusion may simply be a false belief
engendered by visual stimuli, though that doesn't seem to capture normal usage -
<q>For all the world it <em>looks like</em> he's floating in mad-air</q>. But to have
(visual) qualia is, I suppose for there be a way that things look to me. So in
this sense a victim of an illusion requires qualia.
</p>

<p>
I would like an account of how one has an illusion without qualia (or states of
consciousness). Then the claim would not be self-defeating. Of course one can do
this if qualia have causal roles. <a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a> have the
illusion that they are conscious in that they <em>believe falsely</em> that they are
conscious when they aren't. 
</p>

<p>
We can make sense of the causal roles attributed to feels, seeings like, and
other such illusory entities in terms of neural representations and processes
sensitive to them:
</p>
<blockquote>
This involves not transducing the informative events (the signals, if you
will) into a different medium, the imagined MEdium of consciousness, but
translating or transforming the signals into neural representations that are
well-suited to permit representation-users to extract what they need.
</blockquote>

<p>
So consciousness is not required in order to explain the belief that we are
conscious, nor the belief that we are responding to the way things feel to us.
Philosophical zombies have these beliefs too. They really are subject to the
illusion so why can't we be?

Illusion as deceptive <span id="notes on first reading-3 Nicholas Humphrey's inventions-consciousness an illusion-appearance"></span><strong id="appearance">appearance</strong> vs illusion as sensorily produced false
belief. There is an ambiguity here. Consciousness can be an illusion in the
latter sense but not the former. (There may not be a way things appear to

things appear to them.)

Lovely quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
(fp. 4) I share Humphrey’s admiration for the brain’s inveterate valancing
of well nigh all its inputs, approving some stimulus arrays with an A+ or
B−, while branding others as D− at best, and flunking still others. Indeed
it was Humphrey who first opened my eyes to this perspective. When we see
the brain as never indifferent about what is going on in it, we begin to get
a sense of how control of mental life actually happens: by competition and
coalition among valenced (“emotional”) neural activities. There is no boss
in the brain figuring out what to think about next. There is sometimes a
virtual boss, suppressing some thoughts and working hard to concentrate on
others, but as we all know,

This is supposed to be relevant because Dennet can grant all this (and talk
about it) without granting the existence of qualia (or SoC). <em>We</em> have supposed
that there is <q>a division between pragmatic, businesslike cognition and
ecstatic, emotion-laden affect</q> but there isn't one, and he can explain these
emotional affects in terms of the <q>competition and coalition amng valenced
("emotional") neural activities</q>. Emotional affects are <em>causes</em> and
<em>effects</em> in good standing.  A functional account of these emotional/attentional
affects e.g. <q>the visual system's <em>appetite for</em> color discrimination</q>,
<q>the auditory system's &hellip;  insatiable <em>desire</em> for aural patterns</q> can be
given and hence they are not qualia. (and no qualia are required for the
explanation of the causal affects of emotional
</p>

<p>
On one hand, the fact that these emotional affects are not qualia only shows
that if qualia exist then they must be something else. On the other hand it
seems like Dennett has a more significant issue. In ordinary English
conversations one's attention (among other things) is often explained as being
due to the look/feel of things.  Their beautiful shade of glowing pink that
keeps my attention on the clouds lit by a sunset, and it is precisely because of
the <q>raw feel(/look)</q> of them that I find them so rewarding to look at.
</p>

<p>
If there are raw feels then, at least according to the qualia theorist, they
play no part in causing me to gaze so fixedly at the sunset.  The claim qualia
can be <q>shaved off</q> from these causal roles may be simply implausible.
<a href="philosophical_zombies.html">philosophical_zombies</a> have emotional affects (because emotional
affects are causal properties/states/dispositions/?? in good order) but they
have no qualia.

<blockquote>
(fp. 5) Note that I am not denying the existence of the perceptual
properties of things in the world: colors, sounds, aromas, textures,
liquidity and solidity and the like, any more than I am denying the
existence of dollars, pounds sterling or euros.  These are real things in
the world, as real as real can be, and they are not properties <em>of</em> mental
events but properties <em>represented</em> by mental events. And unlike many other
properties (roughly, what Boyle and Locke called the primary properties)
these “secondary” properties owe their very existence and identity to their
being represented by mental events.
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, this is something Dennett can make good on (like emotional affect,
valencing of sensory perceptions, believing oneself to be conscious) without
accepting qualia.
</p>

<p>
Indeed so:
</p>
<blockquote>
(fp. 6) Affordances are real properties, ubiquitously instantiated in the
world, and minds are good at detecting them. &hellip; But because they are
identified or defined in terms of the proclivities of (normal) minds of one
species or another —usually us H. sapiens— they can be identified as
examples of the benign illusions of our evolved user-illusion.<br>
&hellip;<br>
red things in the world depend for their redness on things that happen in
our heads, but not <em>red</em> things that happen in our heads;
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Dennett is assuring us, with moderate if not perfect plausibility, that he
can make sense of the notion of red (external objects) without relying upon the
existence of red qualia (i.e. without saying red things are things that cause
red qualia under <q>normal</q> circumstances).
</p>

<p>
Hmm, instead of <q>seeing a red qualia</q>, I am in a mental state which represents
something else as being red. Something that has a complex property that causes
me to entertain/construct/manipulate such representations.

<p>
The original question can be put in terms of the following thought experiment:
Suppose you are in a well lit room with your eyes closed and an apple in front
of you on table directly in your line of sight. At the moment you open your eyes
and see the apple, does another red thing, presumably a red mental thing,
spring into existence that did not exist a moment before?
</p>

<p>
Dennett's answer is no - there is no red quale that pops into existence. The
relevant neural state <em>represents</em> something as being red, but is not red
itself. (And that neural state is not a thing - nothing new pops into existence
but the pre-existing neurons/atoms/whatever arrange themselves into a state
where they represent something as being red.)
</p>

<p>
But the qualia theorist might have a stronger view, not only does a red thing
pop into existence the moment you see a red apple, but it may be the only red
thing. The apple itself is not red - its surface has some compelx
electro-chemical property and some disposition to reflect photons of different
wavelengths, but it is not <em>red</em>.
