<blockquote>
MENO: &hellip; I wonder that knowledge should be preferred to right opinion–or
why they should ever differ.<br>
SOCRATES: And shall I explain this wonder to you?<br>
MENO: Do tell me.<br>
SOCRATES: You would not wonder if you had ever observed the images of
Daedalus; but perhaps you have not got them in your country?<br>
MENO: What have they to do with the question?<br>
SOCRATES: Because they require to be fastened in order to keep them, and if
they are not fastened they will play truant and run away.<br>
MENO: Well, what of that?<br>
SOCRATES: I mean to say that they are not very valuable possessions if they
are at liberty, for they will walk off like runaway slaves; but when
fastened, they are of great value, for they are really beautiful works of
art. Now this is an illustration of the nature of true opinions: while they
abide with us they are beautiful and fruitful, but they run away out of the
human soul, and do not remain long, and therefore they are not of much value
until they are fastened by the tie of the cause; and this fastening of them,
friend Meno, is recollection, as you and I have agreed to call it. But when
they are bound, in the first place, they have the nature of knowledge; and,
in the second place, they are abiding. And this is why knowledge is more
honourable and excellent than true opinion, because fastened by a chain.
</blockquote>

<p>
There is a clear and obvious interpretation of this metaphor:
One's merely true opinion may up and leave. One get to talking to some convincing
charmer and all of a sudden your true opinions go wandering off and are replaced
with false ones. If one has (and knows) the reasons for one's belief then it is
(relatively) immune to being abandoned in response to a fast-talker. Of course
one may lose track of one's beliefs without outside assistance. Distraction,
confusion or stress may cause one to forget certain truths. Here again if one
knows the reasons for those claims one is able to reconstruct or deduce them in
the manner of a mathematics student who reproves some lemma that was taught
during their course but which they forget in the stress of the exam.
</p>

<p>
This form of knowledge, true opinion for which one knows the justification (and
that it is a justification) is stable
</p>

<p>
This metaphor is developed in a slightly different way in the <a href="../zz.texts/plato400BC.completeDialogues.jowettTrans.pdf"><cite>Euthyphro</cite></a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
EUTHYPHRO: Nay, Socrates, I shall still say that you are the Daedalus who
sets arguments in motion; not I, certainly, but you make them move or go
round, for they would never have stirred, as far as I am concerned.
<br><br>
SOCRATES: Then I must be a greater than Daedalus: for whereas he only made
his own inventions to move, I move those of other people as well. And the
beauty of it is, that I would rather not. For I would give the wisdom of
Daedalus, and the wealth of Tantalus, to be able to detain them and keep
them fixed. But enough of this. As I perceive that you are lazy, I will
myself endeavour to show you how you might instruct me in the nature of
piety; and I hope that you will not grudge your labour. Tell me, then–Is not
that which is pious necessarily just?
</blockquote>
<p>
This is still an example of a glib talker causing one to lose track of beliefs
for which one thought one had solid support. But in this case the glib talker is
virtuous Socrates and the change he induces is supposed to be the dawning
realisation that what Euthyphro had taken for knowledge is in fact false
opinion. Aporia which is supposed to be a first step towards the potential
acquisition of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
But there is also a change in the sense in which these opinions are in motion.
Here the sense of movement is not (or at least not yet) a change or loss of
belief. Euthyphro has not forgotten that the pious is what is loved by the Gods,
nor has he abandoned his belief in this claim. Now it is his reasons for
his belief that are in flux. He thought he had good reason to believe his claim,
and while he still holds the belief his reasons now appear to him to be less
solid than he had thought.
