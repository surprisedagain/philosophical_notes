A supposed <em>a posteriori</em> necessary truth, inferred from a combination of
<em>a priori</em> analytic and <em>a posteriori</em> synthetic truths. Based upon an analysis
of natural kind terms. Like Kripke's <em>a posteriori</em> necessary truths these hinge
upon taking natural kind terms as involving quasi-indexical

counter position: people <em>believe</em> there are experts who can determine if a

<p>
That there are such things is part of people's theory concerning beeches, gold
etc., . Part of <em>THEIR</em> theory, there is in this no division of linguistic

<q>Water is H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O</q> is inferred from a combination of necessary truths known
<em>a priori</em> and contingent truths discovered by empirical investigation.
The necessary truth is:
</p>
<blockquote>
"water" is stuff that bears a certain similarity relation to the water
around here. Water at another time or in another place or even in another
possible world has to bear the relation same<sub><small>L</small></sub><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. same_liquid</span></span> to
our "water" in order to be water.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
This principle was an <em>analysis</em> of the term water. 
Putnam claimed, quite convincingly, that <q>water</q> was
a natural kind term, and <q>the predominant sense of natural kind words</q> 
was one in which they were true of <q>whatever things share the nature 
that things satisfying the description normally
possess.</q>. Sharing the nature was a matter of having the same 
<q>hidden structure</q><span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext"><q>To sum up: if there is a hidden structure, then generally it determines what it is to be a member of the natural kind, not only in the actual world, but in all possible worlds.</q> (<a href="../zz.texts/putnam1975-meaningOfMeaning.pdf">_ibid.,</a>) </span></span>
And in the case of

is one in which being a member of natural kind is a matter of having the same
Which, in the case of liquids such as water, was a matter of having the same
chemical structure.
In other words, the statement <q>All water bears the relationship same<sub><small>L</small></sub> to
the water around here.</q> is true by virtue of the meanings of the terms it
contains. (Most particularly, though of course not solely, the meaning of the
term <q>water</q>.)

<p>
what does it <q>mean</q> to claim that this is an analysis of water. What would
show that this analysis is false.
</p>

<p>
If we discovered another compound with the same superficial proeprties as water
(a potable, transparent liquid) but with a differenct chemical composition mere
linguistic propriety would force us require us to call it something other than
water (as opposed to describing this discovery
