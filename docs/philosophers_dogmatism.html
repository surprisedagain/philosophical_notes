How is it that philosophers are so damn sure of themselves when none of them
agree?

<p>
the problem is simple. all these philosophers are so damn confident. So sure that
reason dictates that their theories are correct, and yet they all disagree with
each other.
</p>

<p>
surely this casts doubt on philosophers claims. For the non-philosopher it seems
that no philosopher is rightly . If there were good reasons

van Inwagen presents the matter more politely(????/discretely/politicly) in

The principle that

assures us that two philosophers may each be justified in confidently (at least
&gt;50%) holding incompatible theories true. And the "slack" that gives rise to
this the justification of such excessive confidence

<p>
theories 
but this only explains a fraction of the excessivwe confidence with which
philosophers hold their theories.
</p>

<p>
but even if different philosophers may be more confident with this there is
still an excess of confidence to be explained.

NO doubt there <em>is</em> a great deal of irrationality among philosphers.
