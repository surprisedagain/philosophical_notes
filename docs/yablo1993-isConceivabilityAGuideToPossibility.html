Yablo's use of the word <q>verify</q> irritates me. A strange and unhelpful
twisting of the word's normal sense. A twisting which helps support the
illegitimate comparison with perception. The <q>imagining a world</q> seems an
unhelpful addition which obscures the lack of a substantial point.
But this should be taken up in <a href="yablo1993-isConceivabilityAGuideToPossibility.html">yablo1993-isConceivabilityAGuideToPossibility</a>
</p>

<p>
Is this just an update of Descartes' <q>conceive clearly and distinctly</q>
[??
Furthermore to <q>conceive that p</q> one must imagine a world in which p is
true (<q>that verifies p</q> or at least that the imginer <q>takes to verify
p</q>) and one must imagine this world in sufficient detail to exclude the
possibility that not p.

<blockquote>
From examples like these, one obvious conjecture would be that the truth
conditions of an intentional state (assuming it has some) are a function of
its content.(^15) But consider someone who, rather than believing that
DeGaulle liked cheese, inwardly denies that he did. This person's state has
the same content as the believer's, yet unlike the believer's state it is
correct just in case DeGaulle did not like cheese. So, the truth conditions
of an intentional state cannot be read of its content alone; as the examples
of denial, expectation and memory show, the state's psychological mode or
manner is also relevant.  This is crucial because one thing I will be taking
"conceivability involves the appearance of possibility" to mean is that
the truth conditions of an act of conceiving that p include, not the
condition that p, as in perception, but the condition that possiblyp. From
now on I will express this by saying thatp's possibility representatively
appears to the conceiver.
</blockquote>

<p>
The slip here is to considering the <q>truth conditions of an act of conceiving
thatp</q>, and the choice of <q>denial</q> as a distinct attitude towards an
intentional states content is a deviously misleading choice of example,
carefully selected so as to permit this slip.
<span id="Is Conceivability a Guide to Possibility-notes on first reading-§ II-!9"></span><span class="tag" id="!9">!9</span> !!!!
</p>

<p>
Let us change this to a more straightforward example - commanding. To command
something is to do (or issue) something that has intentional content all right.
On a more or less Gricean account of commanding perhaps issuing a command is
just doing something that provides listeners(/observers) with evidence that one
is in the mental state of commanding something. Or perhaps commands themselves
are the objects with intentional content. But in either case commands <span id="Is Conceivability a Guide to Possibility-notes on first reading-§ II-don't"></span><strong id="don't">don't</strong>
have truth conditions. Someone who issues a command issues something that is
not true or false but something that may be fulfilled or unfulfilled.
</p>

<p>
Just as the inward <em>denial</em> that De Gaulle liked cheese is not <em>correct</em> if
DeGaulle liked cheese, so too the inward <em>command</em> that someone shut the door is
not <em>correct</em> if someone shuts the door. One can both command that the door be
shut and <em>believe</em> the door is not shut – and even believe that no-one will
follow the order to shut the door – without contradicting oneself, which is to
say without holding intentional states with contradictory truth conditions.
Rather than having truth conditions, commands (even inward ones) have fulfillment
or compliance conditions; conditions under which the orders is fulfilled or
complied with, not conditions under which the order is true. Indicative
sentences are true or false, imperative sentences are not.
</p>

<p>
Like commands, hopes do not have truth conditions either. They may be fulfilled
or dashed. One response to the somewhat pedantic objection that hopes can
<q>come true</q> is to claim that this is just a superficial way of speaking – a
matter of equivocating between the different attitudes that one may have to the
contents of beliefs and statements. This response is, perhaps, technically
sufficient, it seems dubious. If we make free start ignoring this part of
ordinary speech as a mere confusion what else may we dismiss. But in the spirit
of ordinary language, it can be bolstered. We may note that at the moment that
one comes to know that one's hopes are fulfilled they are not longer hopes, but
now beliefs. One's attitude towards the same intentional contents has now
changed, and what was once the fulfillment conditions of a hope has become the
truth conditions of a belief. In the transmutation from hopes to beliefs, ones
hopes do indeed come true. So too for wishing, dreading, yearning, approving,
wanting and all the other intensional attitudes that we know and love. The do
not have truth conditions but a variety of other fulfillment conditions.
</p>

<p>
These are the standard examples of alternative intentional attitudes. In all
these cases the standard account is not that they involve different <em>contents</em>,
but that they involve different <em>attitudes</em>
towards the <em>same contents</em>. There are not special contents of desires that
are different from the contents of beliefs and different again from the contents
of . These intentional states are not distinguished by their contents
</p>

<p>
They are not distinguished by their
contents but by the attitudes towards those contents. The explanatory appeal
of this approach is (or at least was well known). Fodor, was perhapone cannot s one of its
chief champions for a time, and put defended it beautifully.
In his schematic account, to belief something is to have a token with a certain
representational content <span id="Is Conceivability a Guide to Possibility-notes on first reading-§ II-!6"></span><span class="tag" id="!6">!6</span>

It is here that playing fast and loose with the content of denial plays its role
as a vital, but illegitimate, stepping stone. For the fact that one cannot
