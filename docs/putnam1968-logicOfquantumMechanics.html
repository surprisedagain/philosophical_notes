Influential in its day, now generally regarded as flawed/irrelevant.<br>
Very rough notes, unlikely to be refined into something coherent/presentable.
Deliberately lowering my standard to improve completeness.

<p>
geometry as idealisation vs physical reality
</p>

<p>
the claim that straight lines which are equidistant for some length are
equidistant for their entire length is intuitively necessary. (This distance
between parallel lines is constant.)
</p>

<p>
To deny this principle is just as <q>self-contradictory</q> as to claim that an
object is both red and green, both married and a bachelor.
</p>

<p>
And yet General Relativity does just this!

looking at the phase space of as system consisting of N particles
</p>

<p>
Berkhoff and von Neumann
if you look at the measureable subsets of phase space. 
</p>

<p>
boolean algebra
</p>

<p>
hilbert space vector space with a dot product on it - is complete - contains all
the limits. - this would be a useful note
</p>

<p>
span is any linear combination of two vectors

expressed in quantum logic.
