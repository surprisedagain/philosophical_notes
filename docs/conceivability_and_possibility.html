Whatever is inconceivable is impossible.
The most important(/dubitable) use is to take inconceivability as a sign of impossibility.

Cavalier about the distinction. Still a sense that all knowable truths can be
deduced from first principles (this is not undisputed, but it should be).

For later enlightenment philosophers, particualrly English empiricists such as
Hume and Berkeley the prime example (and often the only one dealt with at any
length) is the visual imagination. To conceive something

Nothing, at first view, may seem more unbounded than the thought of man,
which not only escapes all human power and authority, but is not even
restrained within the limits of nature and reality. To form monsters, and
join incongruous shapes and appearances, costs the imagination no more
trouble than to conceive the most natural and familiar objects. And while
the body is confined to one planet, along which it creeps with pain and
difficulty; the thought can in an instant transport us into the most distant
regions of the universe; or even beyond the universe, into the unbounded
chaos, where nature is supposed to lie in total confusion. What never was
seen, or heard of, may yet be conceived; nor is any thing beyond the power
of thought, except what implies an absolute contradiction.<br>

’Tis an establish’d maxim in metaphysics, that whatever the mind clearly
conceives includes the idea of possible existence, or in other words, that
nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible. We can form the idea of a
golden mountain, and from thence conclude that such a mountain may actually
exist. We can form no idea of a mountain without a valley, and therefore
regard it as impossible.
