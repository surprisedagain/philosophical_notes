What are the features which allow us to determine which direction in time is the
future and which is the past?
<br><br>
Why is entropy higher in future? Is increasing entropy definitional (i.e. the
future is whichever direction in time that entropy increases), due to an
asymmetry in physical laws (and which temporal direction is the future can be
determined with regard to that asymmetry) or something else?

<p>
Consider any one of the standard entropy exemplary systems. Boltzman's
balls in microgravity is a good one, a stone falling into a pond is another, a
solar system is also good.
</p>

<p>
The laws of physics determine the trajectories through the state space of this
system. If the laws are determinate then these trajectories are continuous
threads which contain one point in phase space at each moment, one point leading
on to the next (and coming from the one before). If the laws of physics are
probabilistic then each point throws a mist of probability concerning what point
in the phase space it will occupy after a time &Delta;t.  For simplicity we will
focus on the deterministic case, but bear in mind that objections that something
or other doesn't apply in the probabilistic case may be legitimate.
</p>

<p>
Now on the one hand laws of physics are time symmetric, travel in either
direction along these trajectories is permitted by the laws of physics. A
trajectory from StateA to StateB is equally a trajectory from StateB to
StateA.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand the second law of thermodynamics says that entropy in this
(total) system is monotonically increasing. That for all t<sub><small>1</small></sub> and t<sub><small>2</small></sub> if
t<sub><small>2</small></sub> is after t<sub><small>1</small></sub> the entropy of the system at t<sub><small>2</small></sub> is greater than or equal
to the entropy of the system as t<sub><small>1</small></sub>.
[ âˆ€t<sub><small>1</small></sub>, t<sub><small>2</small></sub>(Later(t<sub><small>2</small></sub>,  t<sub><small>1</small></sub>) &rArr;. E(S, t<sub><small>2</small></sub>) &ge; E(S, t<sub><small>1</small></sub></span></span> ]
</p>

<p>
Now the puzzle is set - according to the laws of physics entropy decreasing
paths are just as physically possible/likely as entropy increasing, but
according to the <q>second law</q> we will only see entropy increasing paths.
</p>

<p>
There are many fewer low entropy states than there are high entropy states.
</p>

<p>
This solution feels rather Bayesian. OK the number/likelihood of
high entropy &rarr; low paths is exactly the same as that of low &rarr; high entropy
paths but, the Bayesian says (as they always do) this is to ignore the base
rate. The vast majority of paths are high &rarr; high entropy states.
</p>

<p>
<em>Given</em> that you have a path with one low entropy end, the odds
are that the other end is high entropy. And this is perfectly compatible with
there being equally many high&rarr;low as low&rarr;high paths. Whats unusual is that you
have a path with a low entropy end <em>at all</em>.
</p>

<p>
But this seems to leave unexplained why the systems I see all come with low
entropy earlier and high entropy later. And this problem can be considerably
sharpened as follows:
</p>

<div id="direction of time-the puzzle-Boltzmann brains"><h3 id="Boltzmann brains" class="header"><a href="#direction of time-the puzzle-Boltzmann brains">Boltzmann brains</a></h3></div>
<p>
If I know that the system is within a <q>ball</q> in statespace (since all my
observations/measurements have error bars) at this moment. And I know the laws
of physics (i.e. the permitted statespace trajectories) so I also know that most
of the trajectories passing through that <q>ball</q> of low entropy states 
go on (in future) to high entropy states. Thus I am justified in believing that
the entropy of the system will increase in future.
</p>

<p>
<span id="direction of time-the puzzle-Boltzmann brains-But"></span><strong id="But">But</strong> exactly the same line of reasoning leads me to believe that the entropy of
the system will increase in past as well.
</p>

<p>
The puzzle, on this view, is <em>not</em> merely <q>Why is entropy so low at the start
of the universe?</q> but <q>How can I be justified in believing that entropy is
low at the start of the universe?</q>. i.e. Why does my justification for
believing that entropy increases in future not also justify me in believing 
that it increases in past.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion is that you/(your brain) is the minimal divergence from a very
high entropy state. While not a <q>new rationale for skepticism</q> it is a
<em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of this explanation for (future) increasing entropy.

Some philosophers, such as Huw Price, seem to take seriously the possibility
that time's arrow does not point in the same direction in all aprts of the
universe. This seems preposterous to me, but since others
