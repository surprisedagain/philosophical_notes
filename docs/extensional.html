The extension of a predicate is the class of objects of which it is true.
The term <q>extension</q> is commonly used(/extended) to apply to names and
relationships as well. 
The extension of a name is the object it names/refers to.
The extension of a relationship is the class of tuples of objects of which it is
true.
</p>

<p>
An occurrence of a term (that has an extension) is <span id="extensional-short--extensional"></span><strong id="extensional">extensional</strong> iff every
replacement of that term with another that has the same extension (i.e. is true
of the same tuples of objects) produces a sentence whose truth value is the
same as the original.

The disputed doctrine that

the language is which the world may be completely described OR

is purely extensional (i.e. all grammatically correct occurrences of terms are
extensional).

<p>
The notion of extensional terms/contexts/sentences has a straightforward
connection to truth functional connectives.
</p>

<p>
In a extensional context the extension of a predicate(/relationship) and the
object referred to by the term to which that predicate is applied determines
the truth of the containing sentence(/sentential phrase).
</p>

<p>
The truth of any truth functional combination is sentences is determined by the
truth value of those sentences. (i.e. exchanging one sentential phrase with
another with the same truth value will not change
</p>

<p>
So any sentence formed by joining extensional sentences(/sentential phrases)
with truth functional connectives will also be extensional.
