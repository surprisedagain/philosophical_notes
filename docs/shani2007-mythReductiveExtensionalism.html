Of interest because it promised to give examples of the (supposedly mistaken)
motivations for extensionalism.

<p>
According to the author <a href="extensional.html#extensionalism">extensionalism</a> is the doctrine that there are only
extensional objects. The orthodox view is that it is languages or occurrences of
terms that are <a href="extensional.html">extensional</a>, and extensionalism is the doctrine that such a
extensional languages are adequate to describe the world (i.e. to express
all good (??) scientific theories).
</p>

<p>
Shani's account of extensionalism is so strange that it is not clear if it it is
equivalent to the orthodox definition.
</p>

<p>
To me the idea that there are two <q>sorts</q> of objects, intensional ones and
extensional ones is a terrible way of discussing extensionalism. It is language
that is intensional of extensional not objects.  Can we warp this over to
intensional and extensional objects if we try really hard? First we need to know
the distinction between intensional and extensional objects.
</p>

<p>
Eventually (8 pages into an 18 page paper) we are given definition of the
term <q>extensional entity</q> viz.,
</p>
<blockquote>
(fp. 8) Intensional entities are contrasted with extensional entities like
concrete objects, or sets, which, unlike the former, abide by the
extensionality principle: extensionally equivalent sets are, ipso facto,
identical, and so is the case with co-instantiated concrete individuals.

<p>
Consider the example:
</p>
<blockquote>
(fp. 5) S<sub><small>3</small></sub>: Doolittle believes that all pelicans are feathered.
</blockquote>

<p>
Apparently the intensional objects involved in this assertion are pelicans:
</p>
<blockquote>
Such sentences are attitude reports (Crane 2001, p. 21); they describe the
attitudes taken by a psychological agent (Doolittle) toward an intentional
object, or objects (pelicans).
</blockquote>

<p>
Now as it stands the English expression Doolittle's belief
For the moment let us assume that pelicans are extensional objects
belief or the English expression that belief (i.e. the sentence <q>All 
pelicans are feathered</q> may contain reference to
extensional objects (i.e. pelicans)
