<p>
Grue cases involve two theories. One a familiar, well known theory supported by
empirical evidence by which we have been duly impressed; and, for that and
other reasons, we are justified in believing the sentences of that
theory with high (though not uniformly high) confidence. The sentences
of that theory contain various predictions concerning our future observations
and so too we are justified in believing those predictions. There are well known
concerns, such as the problem of tacking, which 
restrictions about such theories, perhaps the best known is the problem of
tacking. We would not want to count all the sentences
</p>

<p>
The second theory is produced from the first by systematically replacing all the
instances of two predicates of the first theory. In the original 
</p>


<p>
Ok let do the most basic version of the problem and then try elaborations and
generalizations from there.
</p>


<p>
We need to take it as a respectably large theory. At least large enough
to be confirmed by the sight of green Emeralds and decisively refuted by
decisively sightings of non-green Emeralds. 
</p>

<p>
The simple version is we have a theory in English which contains the sentence
<q>Emeralds are green</q>. We modify that theory by replacing some of the
sentences that contain the word <q>green</q>unquoted
instance of the word <q>green</q> with 
predicates we are famiLets take it that this is a very large theory,
perhaps someones total theory, if people have total theories. At a minimum a
person's total theory would
contain all the sentences a speaker was disposed to assent to at a particular
time. But, it is at least tempting to expand what we count as a persons total
theory beyond those bounds, if
prompted. or at least the set of sentences they would
expanded??increased??supplemented
The sentences a person holds true may 
One way it might be expanded is by including all the sentences the 
assent to, or be prepared to claim were true even indirectly (<q>Every statement
produced by that machine is true,</q> is only a single sentence and it does not
imply 
</p>

<p>
But the range of sentences we count as being in a speakers theory
one way to claim that an infinite
class of sentences is true without, in the most direct and concrete way,
asserting them. The first expansion beyond those sentences they are prepared to
assent It may be contrasted with <q>Every statement produced by that machine is
a theorem of first order logic,</q> by contrast is a single assertion, but from
it the person may be disposed to infer an infinite number of other it
may imply (in combination with claims about the denoted machine's products) an
infinite number of <del>statements</del>.
</p>

<p>
In either case various artificial constructs may enable us to alleviate concerns
arising form the finitude of the human mind and the infinite number of sentences
a theory may contain.
</p>

<p>
those sentence they could be lead to 
Down this path lie concerns that anything comprehensive enough to plausibly<span class="tooltip">&dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">unsplitting this infinitive sucks</span></span> be
someone's total theory will inevitably be inconsistent. So we will need some
logically consistent subset of all those sentences and there may be more than
one way to choose.
</p>

<p>
perhaps merely a well developed, and all scientific theory, the most relevant in
this case seems to be chemistry. The concern there is that there will be other
connected claims in other fields, which may perhaps preclude the kind of theory
mutilation involved in grue cases.

<p>
there is a somewhat poetic idea that <q>the speed of light is gods way of
stopping everything from happening at the same place</q>
</p>

<p>
The idea is a flight of fancy. So central. Although the notion distance is that
which light takes time to traverse.
</p>

<p>
There is no obvious contradiction in supposing that light travels
instantaenaously and yet the universe is spatially extended.
</p>

<p>
However, what gives rise to the phenomena of space is the time it takes for the
effects of events at one point to propagate.
</p>

<p>
In any case this is merely a inspiration, a suggestive way of putting things.
Rather than considering spacetime to be fundamental, and then taking the maximum
transmission of . We can take the maximum speed at which an event's causal effects 
can propagate at space time as giving rise to that spacetime structure. Fix the
distances between each pair of points and you get the space. One could regard
the spacetime distances between spacetime points and then treat the space as a
way of organising them. Indeed this is the point of relativity. Any spaces which
differ by being merely translations, rotations or mirrorings of each other
are all equally acceptable and the idea that the choice of one of them is right
and the others wrong is an error.

<p>
Just as it is the delay with which

<p>
We are in a sense, looking for the grian of the universe. The properties that we
are justified in projecting into other places and times than those we have
already observed.
