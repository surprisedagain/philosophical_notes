An unacceptably simplistic mathematical model is used in an attempt to show that
representing the world doesn't pay off.

So bad its not worth relating to anything at this point. If it becomes popular
it may be worth linking to those later mentions

<p>
The model/case they imagine is ridiculously restrictive. So There is not need to
represent objects or structures out in the world because there are no objects
interacting with each other - in fact nothing happens in the world at all. So
the creatures are in such a simple world that there is no point/survival value
is representing what goes on in the world. 
</p>

<p>
That was my main objection - but that criticism (though I think it still
correct) is not the best I have heard - there was someone else on the server who
did a great job of dismantling it. let me try and remember:
</p>

To translate the situation modelled in the paper into ordinary language: there
are these creatures who eat apples. There are two colours of apple: red and
green. Red apples come in two varieties: common nothing burgers (nothing
apples?) and very rare but highly nutritious apples. Green apples are always
somewhat more nutritious than nothing apples.
</p>

<p>
Creatures are given a selection of red and green apples and must choose one to
eat.
</p>

<p>
"Truth seekers" see a red apple and concludes that it is a nothing apple since
they are far more common. Thus given a choice they will choose green apples.
</p>

<p>
"Fitness seekers" in a sense don't care whether red apples are nothing apples or
highly nutritious - they just know that they are rewarded for eating red apples
(because the occasional nutritious red more than makes up for all the lost
opportunities in eating nothing apples).
</p>

<p>
This is not a choice between <q>truth</q> and <q>fitness</q>. Its a choice
between those who can, in a sense form the belief that there is a 10% (or
whatever) chance of red apples being highly nutritious, and those how can only
form binary beliefs - creatures who can only believe <q>Its a nothing apple</q>
<q>Its a nutritious apples</q>.  The <q>truth seekers</q> can only form
binary/absolute beliefs. They are unable to unable to form the belief "there is
a 20% chance its highly nutritious and 80% chance its a nothing apple".
</p>

<p>
If you are that kind of creature then it probably IS a good idea not to form
beliefs about the world. But WE are NOT that sort of creature so meh - who
cares. The take home message is, I suppose, sufficiently stupid creatures in
sufficiently simple worlds shouldn't bother having beliefs. (Though even that is
generous - perhaps the real take home is - having degrees of belief is good.)
</p>

<p>
The whole paper is kind of awful - the key info about their mathematical model is
buried in an appendix which is far away from the rest of the description of
the thought experiment - making it needlessly (perhaps deliberately?)
difficult to understand. The numbers of the example of very carefully chosen.
The probability notation is wrong in a few key places, and there is just a lot
of misdirection to distract from how bad the basic maths/example really is. A
terrible paper that may go beyond mere incompetence to being actively
deceptive.
