Both safety and sensitivity are suggested modal criteria for knowledge.<br>
S's belief that P is sensitive iff (if P were false then S would not believe it
S's belief that P is safe iff (In all nearby worlds where S believes that P, P
is not false.)<br>
</p>

<div id="main"><h1 id="main" class="header"><a href="#main">main</a></h1></div>
<p>
Both these criteria for knowledge were suggested as ways of strengthening
the requirements for knowledge in order to avoid <a href="gettier_counterexamples.html">gettier_counterexamples</a>.

<p>
The term <q>epistemic safety</q> was first introduced in
<em>How to Defeat Opposition to Moore</em> (Sosa, 1999, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7).">https://doi.org/10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7).</a>
</p>

<p>
In the original formulation, safety was defined as follows: <br>
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td>
<span id="main-safety-S's belief in P is safe Df.&harr; If S were to believe P, P would be true"></span><strong id="S's belief in P is safe Df.&harr; If S were to believe P, P would be true">S's belief in P is safe Df.&harr; If S were to believe P, P would be true</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
(this is the contrapositive of <a href="epistemic_safety_and_sensitivity.html#sensitivity">#sensitivity</a>)
</p>

<p>
Combined with a Lewis analysis of counterfactuals this is interdeducible with: <br>
<q>In the nearest possible world in which S believes P, P is true.</q> <br>
This has the immediate implication that all true beliefs are safe.
</p>

<p>
Sosa appears to have intended the stronger and more interesting definition:
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td>
<span id="main-safety-S's belief in P is safe Df.&harr; In <em>all nearby</em> possible worlds where S believes P, P is true."></span><strong id="S's belief in P is safe Df.&harr; In <em>all nearby</em> possible worlds where S believes P, P is true.">S's belief in P is safe Df.&harr; In <em>all nearby</em> possible worlds where S believes P, P is true.</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<div id="main-sensitivity"><h2 id="sensitivity" class="header"><a href="#main-sensitivity">sensitivity</a></h2></div>
<p>
S's belief that P is epistemically sensitive
iff
if P were false S then would not believe that P
</p>

<p>
It is tempting to combine this with David Lewis's analysis of counter-factuals
to produce the claim that <span id="main-sensitivity-!2"></span><span class="tag" id="!2">!2</span>
</p>


<div id="main-sensitivity-abominable conjunctions"><h3 id="abominable conjunctions" class="header"><a href="#main-sensitivity-abominable conjunctions">abominable conjunctions</a></h3></div>
<p>
The term abominabkle conjunction is from
DeRose 1995
DeRose, Keith, 1995, “Solving the Skeptical Problem”, The Philosophical Review, 104(1): 1–52. <a href="doi:10.2307/2186011">doi:10.2307/2186011</a>

dreadful conjunction
