Russell's objections are the most interesting thing about Lipkind's paper.

<p>
Two problems are raised. Lipkind unsuccessfully tries to tie them together
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Contiguity between cause and effect in a continuous (in time and space or in
   space-time) world. In any such system any two instants are either
   identical or separated by some time interval, never contiguous. Hence an
   two events at distinct instants cannot be contiguous.

<li>
Effects are brought about by the whole complex assemblage of conditions that
   obtain just before they occur, rather than one particular event. (The shove
   caused the woman to fall - but only because she was not braced for it, there
   was no counter shove at the same time, gravity, friction between her feet and
   the floor, etc. All these together caused her to fall and singling out any
   one factor seems arbitrary.)

</ol>

<p>
Russell appears to be exclusively concerned with the first problem, Lipkind
almost exclusively with the second.

Starting with a dictionary definition of <q>cause</q> seems somehow antiquated.

<div id="Russell on the notion of cause-notes on first reading-objection from temporal contiguity"><h3 id="objection from temporal contiguity" class="header"><a href="#Russell on the notion of cause-notes on first reading-objection from temporal contiguity">objection from temporal contiguity</a></h3></div>
<p>
Russell's objections connected with temporal contiguity of cause and effect seem
tedious. Arising from considering time to be infinitely divisible into points in
time. Between any two points in time there are an infinite number of other
points - hence no two points in time are contiguous. Hence causes and effects
cannot be contiguous instants in time. On the other hand periods of time can be
contiguous - say the periods 1:59am&le;t&le;2am and 2am&lt;t&le;2:01am. (provided one
region is open and the other closed). But then why did the cause exist for a
time before <q>exploding into the effect</q>?
</p>

<p>
Turning the flashlight on caused the heat to rise on the surface of the
illuminated body. At the instant the cause occurs a signal is emitted. At the
instant a signal reaches the locus of the effect the effect
begins. The (most proximal) cause and its effect are contemporaneous. Perhaps
not the 'folk' notion of cause, but seems like it might do.  In any case not
nice to take a notion not built for application to the infinitely divisible and
then raise problems with it on that score.
</p>

<p>
Not nice because it hinges upon a kind of concealed hypocrisy or double
standard. If one is prepared to assert that time is infinitely divisible into
instants then one should adopt the same attitude towards causes.  Rather than a
chain of causation composed of distinct links one has a continuous rope of
causation. Just as temporal periods are infinitely divisible into instants so
too causal links are infinitely divisible in both space and time.  Just as no
two instants in time are contiguous, no instantaneous slices of a causal rope
are contiguous (but regions are). Problems are created by inconstantly adopting
infinite divisibility.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that causes and their effects, when they occur at the same point in
space, also occur at the same time. Is this really incompatible with the
ordinary notion of cause and effect? At the moment the signal (proximal cause)
reaches the locus of the effect the effect begins. Isn't this the same as at the
signal's origin. At the moment the electricity begins to flow the
electro-magnetic wave begins to propagate.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I have underestimated the value of Russell's criticisms. And the
<q>infinitely divisible</q> analog of causation differs from causation in some 
key ways assumed in the folk account of causation. Maybe temporal/spatial
infinite divisibility is enough to discredit causation after all.
</p>

<p>
Lipkind appears to recognise none of this.
</p>

<div id="Russell on the notion of cause-notes on first reading-objection from temporal contiguity-Lipkind's response"><h4 id="Lipkind's response" class="header"><a href="#Russell on the notion of cause-notes on first reading-objection from temporal contiguity-Lipkind's response">Lipkind's response</a></h4></div>
<p>
Rather than requiring consistent adoption infinite divisibility Lipkind simply
denies it.
</p>
<blockquote>
Talk of earlier and later stages of an event are beside the point if an
event cannot be endlessly divided, which must be the case with states of
affairs where there is no basis at all for talking of an event's having
parts. (fp. 706)
</blockquote>
<p>
Breathtaking
</p>
<blockquote>
intuitively, most ordinary causal ties include such intervals: the
soldier is punished some time after his act of insubordination. Such
examples suggest not that there are no causal ties, but that the proposed
analysis of causation is mistaken. 
</blockquote>
<p>
Besides the point. There may be chains of causation, but not gaps in the chain.
One supposes that the soldier's act caused (in combination with other factors)
other soldiers observations, which caused decisions, reports, more observations,
more decisions, and finally the punishment being inflicted. But if there are
gaps in the chain which are not filled by intermediate causes, then why on earth
are the gaps the length they are?
</p>

<p>
Just going from Lipkind's quotes Russell makes it clear that he is concerned
with fundamental/proximal causes. Links in the chain that are directly connected
to each other, not links connected by intermediate links. (This is in fact what
first prompted me to think of continuous causal ropes rather than discrete
causal chains.) If time is infinitely divisible then there are no contiguous
instants and no directly connected causes and effects. (Just as there are always
other instants between two particular instants, there are more intermediate
causes and effects between any cause and its effect.)
</p>

<p>
Russell's driving concern is that if there are gaps the causes don't
necessitate their effects:
</p>
<blockquote>
It is useful to turn to Russell for the basic argument: whenever cause and
effect are separated by a time interval, he wrote, "however short we make
the interval, something may happen during the interval which prevents the
expected result." (fp. 706)
</blockquote>

<p>
Lipkind gets distracted from proximal vs distal causes to simple vs complex
causers. He ends up taking fundamental causes to be complex <q>assemblages of
conditions</q> citing Mill for support.
</p>

<p>
Lipkind's "solution" goes as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
The possibility of conditions intervening between cause and effect is
genuine, but it need not pose such a serious problem for a theory of
causation. It does so only if the causal statement, "a caused b" is
understood to assert that the occurrence of the cause by itself necessitated
the occurrence of the effect, that the effect could not but occur given the
occurrence of the cause. If, on the other hand, the statement is interpreted
as saying that a, in the circumstances that were the case at the time,
necessitated b, then the difficulty disappears. (fp. 709)
</blockquote>

<p>
Right - so if we can get causes to be complex assemblages then this can allow
there to be gaps between causes and effects. Causes only necessitate their
effects if the gap is filled in in a "normal" (or ceteris paribus condition
fulfilling) way. Beyond tedious.
</p>

<p>
The ceteris paribus way of allowing causes that do not necessitate their effects
is then chased for several pages
This is a slip, from saying that causes do not necessitate. But for the ceteris
paribus clauses to be rleevant there has to be a causal relationship between the
non-ceteris paribus
</p>


<p>
Then the next step is to avoid necessitating causal laws altogether.  But this
is a slip from the ceteris paribus conditions to pure probability. The is no
ceteris paribus clause that says that the most likely thing will happen.  The
most reputable
</p>

<p>
Lipkind's eventual conclusion on this front is that we can have causes which

<p>
Lipkind takes the question to be: Do <q>causal concepts, in some sense
recognizably similar to our intuitive understanding play any role in modern
scientific theory and explanation</q><span class="tooltip">((dagger;<span class="tooltiptext">fp. 716</span></span>?
</p>

<p>
L then defers to Nagel's claim that only <q>laws asserting "invariable sequential
ordering among events or properties</q> are causal. (Ah modern philosophy.) And
then <q>questions</q> Nagel's criteria to arrive at a criterion of asymmetry.
</p>

<p>
<q>A physical law in not just a mathematical formula</q> 
</p>

<p>
But this misses the point - we are free to imagine some regularites have some
mysterious extra causal quality. But there is no reason to believe anything but
reularities. Insofar as scientitifc theories are theories in which we can/are
justified in believing them. If it were just a matter of whether we <em>can</em>
believe in causation I suppose that is settled by the fact that people do
(though even that is questionable - is the notion of causation coheerent)
</p>

<p>
Can we ever be justified in believing there is a causal connection. Does the
attribution of causal relationships play any part inthe theories we are
<em>justified</em> in believing. (This is why we are interested in <em>scientific</em>
theories - they are the ones we are [best] justified in believing.)

<blockquote>
Our picture of the world becomes more, rather than less, complex as these
factors are discovered, for it is primarily by recognizing what kinds of
factors enter into our laws and explanations that we slice up the world
into separate events, as least past the most elementary stages of life.
Demands for explanation require increasing precision in our recognition of
different types of things (thus the ascription of blame requires our
distinguishing the motive for an action from the action itself). As our
demands and our curiosity become more sophisticated, so does our ontology
