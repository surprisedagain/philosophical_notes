Gettier's counter examples to the traditional claim that knowledge is justified
true belief shook the philosophical world and caused renewed interest in
epistemology. Leading to (increasingly despairing) accounts of knowledge in
terms of sensitivity and safety.
</p>

<p>
<p class="smallnote"> However, Plantinga says: </p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="smallnote"> According to the inherited lore of the epistemological tribe, the JTB
[justified true belief] account enjoyed the status of epistemological
orthodoxy until 1963, when it was shattered by Edmund Gettier&hellip; Of course,
there is an interesting historical irony here: it isn't easy to find many
really explicit statements of a JTB analysis of knowledge prior to Gettier.
It is almost as if a distinguished critic created a tradition in the very
act of destroying it<br>

<p>
<p class="smallnote">The text in this and the following ยง are taken directly from Gettier's paper.</p>
</p>

<p>
Suppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job. And suppose that
Smith has strong evidence for the following conjunctive proposition:
</p>
<blockquote>
(d) Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his
pocket.
</blockquote>

<p>
Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him
that Jones would in the end be selected, and that he, Smith, had counted the
coins in Jones's pocket ten minutes ago.
</p>

<p>
Proposition (d) entails:
</p>
<blockquote>
(e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.
</blockquote>

<p>
Let us suppose that Smith sees the entailment from (d) to (e), and accepts
(e) on the grounds of (d), for which he has strong evidence. In this
case, Smith is clearly justified in believing that (e) is true.
</p>

<p>
But imagine, further, that unknown to Smith, he himself, not Jones,
will get the job. And, also, unknown to Smith, he himself has ten coins
in his pocket. Proposition (e) is then true, though proposition (d),
from which Smith inferred (e), is false. In our example, then, all of the
following are true: (i) (e) is true, (ii) Smith believes that (e) is true, and
(iii) Smith is justified in believing that (e) is true. But it is equally clear
that Smith does not know that (e) is true; for (e) is true in virtue of the
number of coins in Smith's pocket, while Smith does not know how
many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief in (e) on a count
of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man
who will get the job

<div id="Gettier counterexamples-second counter-example"><h2 id="second counter-example" class="header"><a href="#Gettier counterexamples-second counter-example">second counter-example</a></h2></div>
<p>
Let us suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following proposition:
</p>
<blockquote>
(f) Jones owns a Ford.
</blockquote>
	
<p>
Smith's evidence might be that Jones has at all times in the past within
Smith's memory owned a car, and always a Ford, and that Jones has
just offered Smith a ride while driving a Ford. Let us imagine, now,
that Smith has another friend, Brown, of whose whereabouts he is
totally ignorant. Smith selects three place-names quite at random, and
constructs the following three propositions:
</p>
<blockquote>
(g) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Boston;<br>
(h) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona;<br>
(i) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Brest-Litovsk.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
But imagine now that two further conditions hold. First, Jones
does not own a Ford, but is at present driving a rented car. And secondly,
by the sheerest coincidence, and entirely unknown to Smith, the place
mentioned in proposition (h) happens really to be the place where Brown
is. If these two conditions hold then Smith does not know that (h) is
true, even though (i) (h) is true, (ii) Smith does believe that (h) is true,
and (iii) Smith is justified in believing that (h) is true.
