<p>
Although it is a completely convincing account of how to define theoretical
<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-concerns-predicates-terms"></span><strong id="terms">terms</strong> it gives no clear guidance as to how to define theoretical <span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-concerns-predicates-predicates"></span><strong id="predicates">predicates</strong>.
</p>

<p>
How, for instance, does one introduce the predicate <q>charged</q>? 
</p>

<p>
Lewis appears to think this is a well solved problem, he may well be right:
</p>
<blockquote>
(End of §1) It may seem atypical: the T-terms are names, not predicates or
functors. But that is of no importance. It is a popular exercise to recast a
language so that its nonlogical vocabulary consists entirely of predicates;
but it is just as easy to recast a language so that its non-logical
vocabulary consists entirely of names (provided that the logical vocabulary
includes a copula). These names, of course, may purport to name individuals,
sets, attributes, species, states, functions, relations, magnitudes,
phenomena or what have you; but they are still names.
</blockquote>

<p>
But this only works if we take predicates as designating properties.
In particular it requires allowing quantification over predicates
e.g.:
</p>
<blockquote>
(∃P,x) x is P
</blockquote>
<p>
(This is why the language requires a copula [<em>is</em>].) This is a Quinean nono.
</p>

<p>
Presumably for Lewis, two properties are identical iff they are true of the same
objects in every possible world.

<p>
This is a well recognised problem - especially with regard to numbers.
literature review would turn up some leads.

<div id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-concerns-causal roles"><h3 id="causal roles" class="header"><a href="#psychophysical and theoretical identifications-concerns-causal roles">causal roles</a></h3></div>
<p>
If one is nervous about causality (as I am) then this is going to be a problem.
Lewis assumes, in effect, that the term <q>causes</q> is already a part of the O
language. Both the problem apply to introducing the term <q>causes</q> and hence
to the notion of <em>causal role</em> which lewis relies upon.

<div id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary"><h2 id="summary" class="header"><a href="#psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary">summary</a></h2></div>
<p>
It is so good that simply quoting the main point in full is better than any
restatement:
</p>
<blockquote>
We now proceed to a general account of the functional definability of
T-terms and the nature of theoretical identification. Suppose we have a new
theory, <em>T</em>, introducing the new terms <em>t<sub><small>1</small></sub></em> &hellip;  <em>t<sub><small>n</small></sub></em>. These are our
T-terms. (Let them be names.) Every other term in our vocabulary, therefore,
is an O-term. The theory <em>T</em> is presented in a sentence called the postulate
of <em>T</em>. Assume this is a single sentence, perhaps a long conjunction. It
says of the entities--states, magnitudes, species, or whatever--named by the
T-terms that they occupy certain <em>causal roles</em>; that they stand in
specified causal (and other) relations to entities named by O-terms, and to
one another. We write the postulate thus:
T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-t"></span><strong id="t">t</strong>].
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Replacing the T-terms uniformly by free variables <em>x<sub><small>1</small></sub></em> &hellip;  <em>x<sub><small>n</small></sub></em> we
get a formula in which only O-terms appear:
T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong>].
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Any n-tuple of entities which satisfies this formula is a realization of the
theory <em>T</em>. Prefixing existential quantifiers, we get the Ramsey sentence of
<em>T</em>, which says that <em>T</em> has at least one realization:
∃ <span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong> T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong>].
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We can also write a modified Ramsey sentence which says that <em>T</em> has a
unique realization:
∃<sub><small>1</small></sub> <span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong> T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong>].
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Ramsey sentence has exactly the same O-content as the postulate of <em>T</em>;
any sentence free of T-terms follows logically from one if and only if it
follows from the other. The modified Ramsey sentence has slightly more
O-content. I claim that this surplus O-content does belong to the theory T
-- there are more theorems of T than follow logically from the postulate
alone. For in presenting the postulate as if the T-terms has been well.
defined thereby, the theorist has implicitly asserted that T is uniquely
realized. We can write the Carnap sentence of T: the conditional of the
Ramsey sentence and the postulate, which says that if T is realized, then
the T-terms name the components of some realization of T:
∃x T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong>] ⊃ T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-t"></span><strong id="t">t</strong>].
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Carnap has suggested this sentence as a meaning postulate for T; 9 but if we
want T-terms of unrealized or multiply realized theories to have the status
of improper descriptions, our meaning postulates should instead be a
modified Carnap sentence, this conditional with our modified Ramsey sentence
as antecedent:
∃<sub><small>1</small></sub><span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong> T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong>] ⊃ T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-t"></span><strong id="t">t</strong>],
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
together with another conditional to cover the remaining cases:
¬∃<sub><small>1</small></sub><span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong> T[<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong>] .⊃. <span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-t"></span><strong id="t">t</strong> = *
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This pair of meaning postulates is logically equivalent to a sentence which
explicitly defines the T-terms by means of O-terms:
<span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-t"></span><strong id="t">t</strong> = ℩ <span id="psychophysical and theoretical identifications-summary-x"></span><strong id="x">x</strong> T[x].
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This is what I have called functional definition. The T-terms have been
defined as the occupants of the causal roles specified by the theory T; as
the entities, whatever those may be, that bear certain causal relations to
one another and to the referents of the O-terms.
