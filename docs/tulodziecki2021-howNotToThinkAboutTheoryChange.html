A middling, though historically detailed and seemingly accurate, motivation
for the <a href="tomb_of_the_mistaken_scientist.html">tomb_of_the_mistaken_scientist</a>, that presents itself as a critique
of scientific realism with profound implications for epidemiology.

<p>
On reflection I realise that the tone of this commentary is excessively snarky
and mean. I dislike the oversold and overblown vacuous academic style that the
author is forced to resort to in order to present their enquiry as being
momentous. Fundamentally this is not a fault of the author but of the publishing
environment in which most academics are required to work.
</p>

<p>
At heart this is a perfectly sound historical account which plausibly points out
that John Snow's evidence for cholera being spread by waterborne faecal matter
was not quite as rock solid as is commonly thought, and the objections of the
miasmatists who opposed him were not quite as groundless. As such this paper is
a commendable correction to a whig history of a particularly famous early
episode in epidemiology. However, the suggestion that this has important
implications for our understanding of (the epistemology of) theory change or
scientific realism still grinds my gears.

<p>
This paper has two conclusions - one blandly true and the other an overblown
vacuity.
</p>

<p>
The bland truth is that the early proponent(s) of a new view, even if it is
later almost universally recognised as correct, will often hold that view on
inadequate evidence. (The example focussed on in the paper is Snow and his
theory of the cause of cholera.) The justification of their beliefs no stronger
than that of their opponents.  Indeed to be prepared to put in the (often
considerable) effort of gathering evidence that might support the new view, may
require an <q>irrationally</q> strong confidence in that view before the
evidence has been gathered.
</p>

<p>
More generally it is not the case that the proponents of false views are less
intelligent, knowledgable or responsive to the evidence, or didn't follow <q>the
scientific method</q> as well. The evidence available to them at the time may
support their view and it is only once other theories (less motivated by the
evidence) are developed and then evidence sought for them that there is reason
for change. (See <a href="tomb_of_the_mistaken_scientist.html">tomb_of_the_mistaken_scientist</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The second false/vacuous conclusion is that this has some deep
implication for epidemiological theory development/evaluation.  We are given no
idea how to turn the vague encouragements to <q>understand that these explananda
[of current epidemiological research] are not independent of the theoretical
framework in which we are operating</q> and <q>explor<del>ing</del> in more detail just
how different approaches to causality in medicine influence the kinds of
questions we ask.</q> into practical implementable advice. Typical academic
waffle - more research needed - more research good - current views not nuanced
enough. (See <a href="the_academic_conclusion.html">the_academic_conclusion</a>)
</p>

<p>
There is however, one significant point on which I agree with author:
Science is dialectical.
</p>
<blockquote>
(p.2584 i) when trying to understand the epistemic merits and flaws of the
water-hypothesis as first proposed by Snow, we need to understand that its
epistemic standing is not independent of the context in which it was raised,
or independent of what rivals were available.
</blockquote>

<p>
We construct a sort of cognitive space large enough to encompass the competing
theories under consideration and then rely upon the agreed features of that
space to evaluate those theories relative to each other. This is also related
to <a href="the_academic_conclusion.html">the_academic_conclusion</a> - The tedium of the advice to expand our
cognitive space - when the real challenge is how to reduce it without
(significantly) increasing our chance of being wrong.
</p>

<div id="discussion notes"><h1 id="discussion notes" class="header"><a href="#discussion notes">discussion notes</a></h1></div>
<p>
just a suggestion of a more nuanced view of scientific realism?
</p>

<div id="discussion notes-section 1"><h2 id="section 1" class="header"><a href="#discussion notes-section 1">section 1</a></h2></div>
<p>
realists selectively - seeking for features in addition to empirical
adequacy(/verified predictions) which would warrant believing that the
objects postulated in scientific theories are real. Or realists can limit the
parts of theories about which they are realists:
</p>
<blockquote>
(p. 2570) In order to make their case, realists of different stripes have
proposed a number of more restrictive realisms according to which we ought
to be realists selectively and only about those parts of our theories
essential to their success
</blockquote>

<p>
simplicity, consilience - yes ok in a sense these are theoretical virtues that
are additional to empirical adequacy(/correct predictions/??)
</p>
<blockquote>
(p. 2571) Although there are many different realist positions, what they all
share is a commitment to the idea that later scientific theories are more
successful than earlier ones and, further, that we can somehow give an
explanation of the success of later theories by appealing to some feature
either of those theories themselves—such as the theoretical virtues—or of
the scientists who came up with them: there is something that those
scientists did right and if we could only capture what that something is, we
would have at least a partial answer to the question of why science so
consistently delivers epistemic achievements.
</blockquote>
<p>
weird view of realism - motivated straw man ?
</p>

<p>
I think the intended conclusion is that it is not some virtue of these theories
that made them <q>win</q>, but rather a virtue they had in comparison to the
alternatives of the time; and hence (??) to look for a distinguishing virtue of
successful theories/ theory developments by just looking at those theories by
themselves is foolish/mistaken.

<div id="discussion notes-section 2"><h2 id="section 2" class="header"><a href="#discussion notes-section 2">section 2</a></h2></div>
<p>
mono-causality is the supposed key distinguishing feature of Snow's account of
the spread of cholera.
</p>

<p>
Presenter suggested Snow's account better described as choleric matter comes
from faeces, and is then ingested. Not such a focus on water transmission (which
Snow did accept/propose). But the idea that it was faecal matter was the key.
</p>

<p>
Miasma theory was the chief alternative.
my question: is the suggestion of being water borne the key difference with the
miasma theory? (i.e. a water miasma wouldn't be too far off?)
</p>

<p>
Is the miasma theory simply the non atomistic version of spread by microscopic
germs? No not quite - germs are living and replicate, rather than causing some
imbalance in bodily processes which manifests as disease.  Still it does seem
like the non-atomistic version - if you don't have microscopic particles (and
hence no microscopic animalcules) then you are pushed towards miasma. If you
have atoms then you are free to postulate microscopic germs, but if you have no
atoms then germ theory is ruled out and miasma (as a kind of diffuse plenum) is
the best option. I think that's right - if you have no atoms then you are pushed
towards a miasma theory.
(See <a href="../01.reasonLanguageNecessity/timeline:_modern_atomism_to_nerve_impulses.html">wn.rLN:timeline:_modern_atomism_to_nerve_impulses</a>)
</p>

<p>
Author claims:
miasma theory made correct novel predictions - very plausible
</p>

<p>
later (in S4)  mentions elevation formula of disease  - an mathematical formula
predicting disease prevalence on the basis of an areas elevation. Fit available
data quite well (though not perfectly).

<div id="discussion notes-section 3"><h2 id="section 3" class="header"><a href="#discussion notes-section 3">section 3</a></h2></div>
<p>
South London water supply study - the authors focus - is not the only study done
by Snow (and more were done by others).
</p>

<p>
South London study highly praised. Perhaps the iconic exemplar of early
epidemiological studies. One gets the impression this is a(/the) textbook
example of how to do epidemiology. Epidemiologists in training are told of this
story (in perhaps an idealised form) and told this is the first (or at least an
early) example of how to do epidemiology right.
</p>

<p>
People already knew/believed cholera was water borne.
</p>

<p>
downstream ??
</p>

<p>
the <q>intermixed</q> water supply where different companies who drew their
water from different places (different point on the Thames - one further
downstream than the other) supplied (unmixed) water to intermixed houses (i.e.
two water companies supplying houses in the same area in a patchwork often one
house having a different supplier than the one across the street) gave rise to
the <q>natural experiment</q>.  The other factors - hygiene, underlying health,
elevation, class?, the sorts of things mentioned in the miasma theory - were
constant (on a population level) because people with different water suppliers
lived right next to each other, under much the same conditions.

<blockquote>
(p. 2578) “that if in this [intermingled] part of London it should be found
that the inmates of the houses supplied with the Battersea water suffered
greatly, and those supplied with Ditton water suffered little, then of
course, as all other circumstances (locality, air, trades, &amp;c.) in the
district are the same, the influence of the water would be proved beyond a
doubt” - quoted from Parkes
</blockquote>
<p>
relative ratios of consumers / cholera cases agreed to be a good method of
deciding the water/poo theory by Snow's critics
</p>

<p>
tidal influence complicates simple downstream is always at least as contaminated
as upstream and maybe more so. Snow's critics point out this problem.
</p>

<p>
Method of determining water supplier by salt level questioned - Snow reports
only a single measurement of the low salt level that distinguished the upstream
supplier.
</p>

<p>
number of people supplied not specified - Snow makes it clear that more downstream
supplied people got sick than upstream supplied people, but (at least according
to quoted critic) does not supply total numbers of households supplied by each
so we don't know background rate of supplier so we can't calculate
<br>Prob(get_cholera GIVEN supplied_by_downstream).

<p>
If there is any meat to this paper it better be here
</p>
<blockquote>
(p. 2583) The more important philosophical point that comes out of
understanding the Snow-episode in this way, however, is that analyzing
Snow’s reasoning alone will not tell us what was so good about the
water-hypothesis and why it ended up being so successful. It did turn out to
be the right view, but what is claimed as the best argument for it—the one
that is often said to have established conclusively that the water
hypothesis is right—cannot tell us what was so good about it, because that
argument was not as good as it seemed. The default assumption in most
current accounts of theory-change, as we have seen, is that because the
winners turned out to be right, their arguments must have been good: because
Snow’s water-hypothesis turned out to be correct, Snow must have done
something epistemically virtuous that explains how he ended up with the
right view and others did not. According to such accounts, Snow was ahead of
his times and his contemporaries should have followed epistemic suit,
adopting his views much earlier than they in fact did. However, not just do
such accounts have trouble with explaining what was so good about this par-
ticular scientific claim, they also leave us with the question of trying to
understand why others did not follow Snow’s epistemic lead.
</blockquote>

<p>
so this is the conclusion ????!!!!
Sometimes people are right when their methods were imperfect, and sometimes
people are wrong when they are epistemically prudent. The
<a href="tomb_of_the_mistaken_scientist.html">tomb_of_the_mistaken_scientist</a>
</p>

<p>
Ah - at last - a desperate bid for significance
</p>
<blockquote>
(p. 2584) It is also this very fact that might make us wonder about the
explananda of current epidemiological research. Just as in Snow’s case, it
is important to understand that these explananda are not independent of the
theoretical framework in which we are operating, and putting ourselves into
the miasmatic mindset can help bring this to the fore. In an age where we
struggle with the etiology of lifestyle diseases, for example, it seems
crucial to understand in what ways our causal background picture influences
what we take to be in need of an explanation (and, perhaps, as a result,
what we consider worthy of prevention or intervention).
</blockquote>

<p>
The <q>explananda of current epidemiological research</q>?  How are they cast
into doubt? This vague claim would work better if we discussed any of these
explananda. Is there any serious alternative to focusing on the
<q>explananda of current epidemiological research</q>. I suppose in a sense the
paper is encouraging us to expand our minds to consider explananda of <em>past</em>
epidemiological research but it doesn't seem like a good use of resources.
</p>

<p>
Then a tedious justification of make our theories (of theory change) more
complex - more complicated understanding is better - our current understanding
is too simple. Agreed the simple story may not do justice to the history (and
the historical opponents of the new view).
</p>

<p>
as the presenter suggested - the epidemiological moral/point/message of the
story is <q>tacked on</q>
</p>

<p>
The claim that there is some moral to be made of this, some practical
modification we can make to evaluating epidemiological theories seems
far-fetched.
