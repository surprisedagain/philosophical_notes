Aja likes Pierson and thinks very highly of them. Various information comes to
light (perhaps reports from other people) that Pierson has done something that
Aja generally thinks is reprehensible. Say Pierson cheated on a test, or stole a
candy from a baby. The evidence is clearcut. However, rather than form the
belief that Pierson has done something reprehensible Aja claims the evidence is
not decisive, going to lengths to invent other implausible explanations of the
evidence (a bird flew down, took the candy and dropped it in Pierson's hand)
rather than form the conclusion that their friend has done something wrong.
