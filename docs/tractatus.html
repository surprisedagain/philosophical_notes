Exposition of Wittgenstein's account of modality

Language represents a system(/the world) by virtue of an isomorphism between
the permissible arrangements of symbols into sentences and the possible
arrangements of the objects they represent.
</p>

<p>
This (purports to) explain how we know necessary truths about such external
systems.  We can be taught the <a href="wittgenstein_grammar_vs_grammar.html">grammatically</a>
permissible combinations of symbols by experience, and the modal structure of
the represented systems MUST be the same since this is a pre-requisite of it
being the thing (the type of thing) that those symbols represent.
</p>

<p>
The apparent dependency on normativity can be largely dispelled by simply
specifying the relevant grammtical constructions explicitly. While it is
normative rules that give rise to "grammaticality" in natural langauges, one can
simply stipulate the set of <a href="wittgenstein_grammar_vs_grammar.html">grammatically</a>
correct sentences and thus establish the relevant space of gramatical
possibilities.
</p>

<p>
There are at least two suspicions remaining however:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Is there still a reliance upon an unresolved knowledge of modality?

</ol>

<p>
	At first, perhaps it seems that we surely know the possibilities of ur own
	minds better than the possibilities of some external objects/states of
	affairs. We can "directly" experience the possibilites of our own mind
	unconstriained by the limits of base external reality.
	How is it that we know what combinations of symbols are possible? But here
	it seems the combinations can be made purely of existing, if "abstract"
	entites and relationships.  Consider <a href="quine's_account_of_logical_truth.html">quine's_account_of_logical_truth</a>
	where the set of grammatically correct sentences and the set of logical
	truths is specified without any reliance upon modal notions at all. 
</p>
 
<ol>
<li>
Is it really the case that "(6.43) . . .
   <a href="the_world_of_the_happy_man.html">the_world_of_the_happy_man</a> is a
   different one from that of the unhappy man"?

</ol>

<div id="theses-basis of logical space"><h2 id="basis of logical space" class="header"><a href="#theses-basis of logical space">basis of logical space</a></h2></div>
<p>
Another aspect of W's approach that must be mentioned is the notion of finding a
logical basis for the space of grammatically correct statements. This is
directly analogous to the notion of a basis of a mathematical vector space.
There the notion is that any vector in the space (mutatis mutandis any point in
the space) can be reached/expressed/constructed as a combination<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">sum of multiples</span></span>
of the members of the basis.

<p>
The technique Wittgenstein uses in section 3.3* is what Carnap later calls
<q>quasi-analysis</q>.
</p>

<p>
The reason for turning to Carnap is not to impose any of his theories of
language, but because he lays out the technique in logically formal detail. In
that sense, Carnap gives the clearest and most precise account of
quasi-analysis.  But be warned, in saying that Carnap is clear and precise I
mean that his constructions are as explicit as formal logic, and not that his
description of what he is doing is easy to understand. Carnap's initial
description of <q>quasi-analysis</q> is cryptic:
</p>
<blockquote>
Generally speaking . . .  quasi analysis is to achieve the following:
unanalyzable units of any kind, a pair list of which is presupposed, are to
be manipulated with the constructional ascension forms of class and relation
extension (i.e., with synthetic methods) in such a way that the result is a
formal substitution for proper analysis (i.e., the analysis into
constituents or properties), which cannot be carried out in this case.
</blockquote>
<p>
Don't worry, an example Carnap gives in a moment will clarify this grammatical
nightmare. But first let me attempt to rephrase his informal description
in words that someone who wasn't already familiar with Carnap's project might
understand:
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have a list of pairs of objects. In the cases we will be interested
in these will be a list of pairs of objects that are like each other in some
way. Each pair might have some property in common, but for whatever reason we are
prevented from producing an analysis of these object's properties. All
we know about these objects is which of pairs of them are on this list (i.e. we
know the extension of the relationship <q>similar-to</q>).
</p>

<p>
On this basis of this single relationship of <q>similar-to</q> we can define
terms that behave like ascriptions of properties that these objects have in
common.
</p>

<p>
Let's try to get clearer on this by considering Carnap's first example:
</p>
<blockquote>
Let there be altogether five different colors. Let us define the relation of
"color kinship" in such a way that it is to hold for two things if these
have at least one color in common. Let the things be individually
designated, for example, by numbers. Now let us assume that we do not know
of any of the things which colors it has. All we have is a pair list (i.e.,
we know only the extension of the relation of color kinship: we are told all
pairs for which this relation holds, but we are not told which color these
two things have in common). In other words, the extension of the relation of
color kinship is completely given. Now, our task consists in inferring from
these data the distribution of colors. We cannot proceed by choosing one of
the things at random and determining all its color kin on the basis of the
pair list, for it does not follow that all these are color akin to each
other.
</blockquote>

<p>
For instance, one object <em>A</em> might be both partly red (and hence
similar[/related by <em>colour kinship</em>] to other objects that are at least
partly red) and partly green (and hence similar[/related by <em>colour kinship</em>] to
other green objects).  But there may be two (or more) objects that are colour
kin to <em>A</em> but not colour kin to each other (e.g. one object that is purely green
and another that is purely red).
</p>

<p>
On the basis of this relation, provided it is symmetric (i.e. anything I am
similar to is similar to me) and reflexive (each thing is similar to itself) we
can determine how many different colours there are, and identify the extension
of each colour (i.e. the classes of objects that are partly that colour), though
of course we cannot identify the colours themselves. We might, for instance,
determine that there are 5 colours and that one colour is shared by objects A, B
and C and another colour and B, C, D and E all share another colour, but we
cannot work out which colour is red or green etc., (Carnap has a problem of
free-loaders. If each partly blue thing is also partly red, the extension of
colour-kinship will not allow us to distinguish blue from red. Wittgenstein does
not have this problem since he is concerned with the space of possible
propositions.)
</p>

<p>
The two principles for assigning colours to objects (or rather objects to colour
classes) are:
</p>
<blockquote>
First of all, any two elements of a color class stand in the relation of
color kinship to one another (because the members of the pair both have the
color which determines the color class). Secondly, the color classes are the
largest possible classes all of whose members are color-akin.
</blockquote>
<p>
Carnap intends to use this technique to deliniate sensation types. Say, seeing a
red square in the lower right quadrant of the visual field, or hearing the tone
middle C.  But he cant find unproblematic sensory elements from which to
composes whole/gestalt sensations.  In particular he is worried that the hearing
of the chord composed of the notes C-E-G is <em>not</em> a sensation that is composed
of hearing C, hearing E, and hearing G, but rather a sort of organic whole that
taken by itself has nothing tri-partite about it. Rather than trying to identify
the property <em>Hearing-C(&hellip;)</em>, he instead simply identifies the set of sounds
which are tone kin to each other without postulating some phenomena which is
common to them all.
</p>

<p>
The trick hinges on quasi-identifying the property with the class of things that
are related by the relevant similarity relation. Attributions of membership of
the relevant class of objects related by colour/tone kinship (or whatever the
relevant form of similarity is) can do the job of attributions of properties.
e.g. instead of saying that A, B and C all have a colour in common, we can say
that they are members of the largest class of objects related by colour
similarity that includes A, B and C.
</p>

<p>
On the basis of the relation of colour similarity we can define a number of
(one-place) predicates such as <em>Colour1</em>, <em>Colour2</em>, in terms of the (two-place)
<em>colour kinship</em> relationship.
</p>

<p>
Instead of talking about the property of <em>being</em> red, or some other constituent of
these objects that is supposed to be common between them, we can instead say
that they are members of a colour class. (i.e. a maximal class of objects that
are related to each other by the <em>similar to</em> relation).
</p>

<p>
We identify (in a loose sense of identity) the common property with the class of
objects that are related to each other by similarity.
</p>

<p>
In short rather that saying <q>P(a)</q> we say [a is a member of {x: x is a
member of a largest set of objects that all bear the similarity relationship to
each other}].
</p>

<p>
Or as W puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all the propositions in which
it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of
propositions.
</blockquote>
<p>
Here just as Carnap built talk of the common colours in terms of classes of
objects that bear the relationship of <em>colour kinship</em> to each other,
W is building talk of common expressions from classes of propositions that have
some kind of similarity to each other.
</p>
<blockquote>
3.312 It [the expression] is therefore presented by means of the general
form of the propositions that it characterizes.
</blockquote>

<p>
Lets see this construction in practice:
</p>
<blockquote>
3.31 I call any part of a proposition that characterizes its sense an
expression (or a symbol).  (A proposition is itself an expression.)
Everything essential to their sense that propositions can have in common
with one another is an expression.  An expression is the mark of a form and
a content.
</blockquote>
<p>
The first fundamental element of the construction is the relationship between
propositions of having the same sense. For if a part <q>characterises</q> the
sense of a containing proposition then changing that part will change the sense
of the proposition - i.e. produce something that is either not a proposition at
all, or is a proposition with a different sense, a proposition that it not
<em>synonymous</em> with the original. Thus the first relationship from which we will
build predicates true of expressions, symbols etc., is <em>sentential synonymy</em>.
This plays the same role in Ws constructions that <em>colour kinship</em> or
<em>tone kinship</em> played in Carnap's constructions.
</p>

<p>
The second fundamental relationship is substitution
i.e. Sub(<em>original proposition</em>, <em>element to be replaced</em>, <em>replacement</em>,
<em>resulting proposition</em>).In ordinary langauge, the result of replacing the
<em>element to be replaced</em> in the <em>original proposition</em> with <em>replacement</em> is the
<em>resulting proposition</em>.
</p>

<p>
So the <em>sign</em> <q>cat</q> <em>is</em> the class of things that can be substituted
into <q>the cat is on the mat</q> without changing its meaning (i.e. which
produces a proposition that is synonymous with <q>the cat is on the mat</q>).
<em>is-an-instance-of-the-sign-cat</em> is a one place predicate that we are building out
of substitution and synonymy relationships just as <em>is-red</em> was the one place
predicate that Carnap built out of colour kinship relations. Now what we really
want is not to specifically mention the particular proposition <q>the cat is on
the mat</q> but rather to say that <em>is-an-instance-of-the-sign-cat</em> is true of
just those things that can be substituted for any instance of the <em>expression</em>
cat without changing their meaning (i.e. preserving sentential synonymy).
</p>

<p>
The <em>expression</em> <q>cat</q> is the class of propositions that contain the sign
<q>cat</q>. There are complications for <q>cat</q> may be contained in various
positions (i.e. directly or within some sub-sentential clause as in <q>the cat
is on the mat and the dog is in the dell</q>). Although the construction is more
complex it does give the pleasing result that 
</p>
<blockquote>
3.314 An expression has meaning only in a proposition. All variables can be
construed as propositional variables.  (Even variable names.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Another and easier example to layout - the <em>symbol</em> (see 3.31 to confirm this is
another term W uses for <em>expression</em>) <q>and</q> <em>is</em> the set of propositions that
can be formed by filling out the schema [. . . and . . .]. And to say of a
concrete proposition that it contains an instance of <q>and</q> is to say that
it is a member of this set. (I have <del>cheated</del> simplified here by ignoring
cases where <q>and</q> is not the primary or base connective.)
</p>
<blockquote>
3.313 Thus an expression is presented by means of a variable whose values
are the propositions that contain the expression.  (In the limiting case the
variable becomes a constant, the expression becomes a proposition.) I call
such a variable a ‘propositional variable’. [see point 2 below]
</blockquote>

<p>
Having gone over the relevant technique of logical (well set-theoretical really)
construction at some length (though not in formal detail) let me make my claims
clear.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
W has these techniques of construction in mind in sections 3.3*. I believe
   that W, while a genius of the first order and an extraordinary philosopher,
   is not a particularly strong logician. Hence I believe that he has seen this
   technique of construction in use (perhaps by Russell or Whitehead, but
   perhaps by others seeking [as we now would put it] to found mathematics in
   set theory) and sees that it can be applied to the problems he is interested
   in. W's techniques are not <q>like</q> or <q>inspired by</q> these forms of
   construction they are precisely what he has in mind, though he omits many
   details and merely says enough to assure himself (and his idealised readers)
   that this construction can be carried through.

<li>
A difference between constructed/quasi-analysed predicates and
   normal/naive predicates is that this construction relies upon the existence of
   sets of objects. You paraphrase <q>x is P</q> as <q>x is a member of a
   specified maximal set of objects bearing a similarity relationship to each
   other</q>. Russell and friends were particularly callow with regard to this
   extra commitment - treating a set as equivalent to a propositional function -
   i.e. the set of red things <em>is</em> (in some sense) the <q>incomplete symbol</q>
   <q>Red(. . .)</q>. Wittgenstein follows suit, and is equally
   unconcerned over the existence of sets, and equally uninterested in
   distinguishing propositional schema from the set of propositions that
   instantiate that schema.

<li>
This is what logic is good for. You may have noticed me criticising attempts
   to paraphrase philosophical arguments in terms of formal logic. The criticism
   being that if the resulting version of the argument is not logically valid,
   the proponent of the original argument can simply maintain that the
   paraphrase is inadequate and very little has been achieved.  If really
   pressed they can claim that the logic in question is not adequate to the form
   of argument (this is Brentano's move, commonly used to reject extensionalist
   logics). By contrast on my view logic is a tool of construction. That you can
   build talk of properties from relations of (symmetrical, reflexive)
   similarity (and some set theory) is a genuine achievement worth noting.

<li>
Ws view of analysis here is akin to Russells view in <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.
   Both W and R take themselves not to be merely showing one way (among many
   others) of constructing the desired pattenr of inferences, but to be
   revealing a structure already present in the objects they are analysing.
   Although I have in a broadly modern/(Carnapian maybe) spirit described this
   as a construction, you can look at this as an epistemic relationship. If you
   can determine the synonymy relationships between sentences then you get
   epistemic access to the rest of the machinery of signs, symbols and the space
   of possible propositions. This is the immediate purpose of the technique.

</ol>

<p>
Finally, the place of this in W's larger project. This is part of a three step
process:
</p>

<p>
1  Identify the expressions of the langauge and how they may be arranged so as
   to form propositions. The fundamental semantic relationship upon which this
   step relies is <em>sentential-synonymy</em> (together with the non-sematic
   relationship of substitution).
</p>

<p>
2  Describe the resulting expressions/range of propositions (a recursive
   definition will be required) in purely natural/non-semantic terms. This is
   when you must not rely upon semantic properties to deliniate the class of
   propositions:
</p>
<blockquote>
3.317 To stipulate values for a propositional variable is to give the
propositions whose common characteristic the variable is.  The stipulation
is a description of those propositions.  The stipulation will therefore be
concerned only with symbols, not with their meaning.  And the <em>only</em> thing
essential to the stipulation is
<em>that it is merely a description of symbols and states nothing about what is signified</em>. [Italics in original]<br>
How the description of the propositions is produced is not essential.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a rôle. It
must be possible to establish logical syntax without mentioning the meaning
of a sign: only the description of expressions may be presupposed.
</blockquote>

<p>
3  You have now deliniated the space of possible propositions in purely
   natural/epistemically accessible terms and have thus both (a) drawn(/shown)
   the limits of what can be thought and (b) given an account of our knowledge
   of necessary (i.e. analytic) truths that is compatible with
   naturalism/empiricism.
</p>

<p>
Finally, note that this whole edifice is built upon the relationship of
sentential synonymy which is taken as fundamental. If that relationship is
epistemically inaccessible then the edifice collapses. This is one way of
appreciating why Quine's attack is so far-reaching.
</p>

<p>
If the world is the totality of facts not things, then a language is a totality
of propositions not symbols. It is upon the relationship of synonymy between
sentences that the identification of symbols, hence the space of possible
propositions, hence the account of representation offered in the <em>Tractatus</em>
relies.

<p>
Fafner: @surprised A relevant passage that I found in the Vienna Circle
collection:
</p>
<blockquote>
Can a form be defined? Can e.g. the subject-predicate form be defined as the
class of all subject-predicate propositions? The subject-predicate form
itself would surely have to occur in such a definition-we would hence
already need to know what the subject- predicate form is, in order to
understand the definition. It is clear that here we are not dealing with
actual propositions but with what makes it possible to form propositions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
If a form were definable, we could not understand it without a definition.
But the possibility of expressing a sense rests on the very fact that we
understand a form without its being explained to us. A proposition shows its
form. The wish to define the very thing on which the possibility of all
communication and information rests does not make sense.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
What is mistaken in this conception is based on construing a form as a
property. The subject-predicate form is taken to be a general property that
all subject-predicate propositions have.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The property fx is a generalization of the property fx.gx. Generalizing
leads from one property to another one.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A form is expressed if the constant parts of a proposition are transformed
into variable ones. This transformation into variables is something entirely
different from generalization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The whole Frege-Russell logic is based on the confusion of concept and form.
The numbers are not concepts. You do not obtain them by means of
generalization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Frege and Russell looked for the essence of number in a wrong direction.
They believed that the number 3 was the result of a kind of generalization
from 3 chairs, 3 plums, etc. And in that way they came to invent the
principle of abstraction so as to express the peculiarity of that
generalization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The number 3 is not the general feature of triplets.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The number 3 does not originate in generalization from particular triplets,
any more than the form of a picture originates in generalization from
particular pictures.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The number 3 is the common form of triplets, not their common property.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The form 3 can only be transposed, it cannot be defined.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Forms have nothing to do with generality. A form is neither general nor
specific
</blockquote>

<p>
surprised: My reaction after a first look is that this confirms my view.
Consider the first line: <q>Can a form be defined? Can e.g. the subject-predicate
form be defined as the class of all subject-predicate propositions?</q>
</p>

<p>
See that here he is talking about exactly the move I was describing above (quite
heavy-handedly 😦 ) As soon as he wishes to define a "form" (i.e. a predicate
true of the class of propositions with that form) the immediate suggestion is to
define it "as" the class of propositions with that form. The identity between a
property and the class of objects with that property is the very first thing he
considers. So I take this as confirmation that he is thinking about the
technique.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yes</q>, I imagine you saying @Fafner, <q>but he goes on directly to <em><span id="specific commentary-cutting room floor-subsequent discussion of commentary on 3.3*:-reject"></span><strong id="reject">reject</strong></em>
that view. Hence your (surprised's) account is mistaken.</q>
</p>

<p>
W rejects it on the grounds that this quasi-identity is something that can only
be shown and not said: <q>If a form were definable, we could not understand it
without a definition. But the possibility of expressing a sense rests on the
very fact that we understand a form without its being explained to us. A
proposition shows its form.</q>
</p>

<p>
Let me make it clear that in my explication of what is going on in W I pay no
heed to the show/say distinction which W is so attached to. My account flowed
from a discussion of the problems of show/say with @Neg F∀lsum and I made it
clear that I was describing Ws semantics without pretending to obey the show/say
distinction and just describing Ws semantic theory directly (i.e. saying the
theory directly) without pretense.
</p>

<p>
I take W to be an outright hypocrite on this point: it is no good to say
something and then take it back saying
</p>
<blockquote>
6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who
understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used
them—as steps—to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the
ladder after he has climbed up it.) He must transcend these propositions,
and then he will see the world aright.
</blockquote>
<p>
Nonsense is nonsense. If it says nothing about meaning it cannot elucidate it
either. Once again, if it can't be said it can't be whistled!
</p>

<p>
Hence I take W's view to be precisely the one I described, only with an added
(and misplaced) doctrine that it cannot strictly be said but only shown.
</p>

<p>
Or to put it another way, if you wish to take the say/show distinction
seriously: My claims about the identity of semantic features and the classes of
propositions having those features "serve as elucidations in the following way:
anyone who understands me (surprised) eventually recognises them as
nonsensical". It is a mere attempt to say what can only be shown, and once you
see what I am showing you can "transcend my claims and see the world aright"
having discarded my claims as, strictly speaking, nonsense.
</p>

<p>
[It turns out I can whistle too!!] 
</p>

<p>
For further confirmation of my view see W's comments on numbers: he wishes to
claim that the same relationship between 3 and collections of three things (i.e.
the exemplification of a form) obtains between propositional forms and
particular propositions. In this case Russell's construction of numbers as the
set of sets with that number of members is precisely an exemplification of the
technique I described. W's is simply the unsayable showable only version of that
technique. (strip out sets and insert the word "form" if you like - even in
talking about forms W is again breaching his own proscriptions against saying
what can only be shown!!)
