Does not carefully distinguish between semantic holism and confirmation holism.
talks of <q>linguistic holism</q> instead.
</p>

<p>
Talks of <q>understanding a sentence</q> and <q>grasping a proposition</q>.
Holism is the doctrine that one cannot understand a sentence without
understanding <q>every sentence of the langauge</q>
Author judges such holism implausible.
</p>

<p>
Atomism (i.e. <q>any word or sentence can be understood independent of any other
word or sentence whatsoever</q>) judged equally implausible:
</p>

<p>
Natural suggestion to explore whether there is some boundary less that the whole
language which must be <q>understood</q> in order to <q>understand a [given]
sentence</q>. Apparent objective of the first two sections to discredit this
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
OK, now distinguishes the Duhem-Quine thesis as an alternate form of holism.
This may well be what I call confirmation holism.

The suggested relationship is that a theory of meaning (perhaps a Davidsonian
theory of meaning as fixer of truth conditions) is itself only confirmed as part
of a larger theory. No mis-prediction can be traced back to any specific
statement.
</p>

<p>
further:  <q>linguists engaged in developing a theory of meaning for some language
cannot do so independently of constructing an overall psychological account of
the speakers</q> (p.229)
</p>

<p>
I think i believe that this is true but somewhat besides the point. Would need
to reflect more carefully. I think I suppose one implies the other via sum(P)&gt;1.
