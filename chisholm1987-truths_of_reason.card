====== summary ======
A prime example of the continued grip of the traditional view of reasoning and
_a priori_ knowledge on modern philosophers.

= response =
=== An initial concern ===
    (p.1.1) Reason, according to one traditional view, functions as a source of
    knowledge. This view, when it is clearly articulated, may be seen to
    involve a number of metaphysical presuppositions.

That reasoning is a source of knowledge is not in dispute.  The concern,
however, is that under this undisputed element of the <q>traditional view</q>,
Chisholm will smuggle in a very questionable theory of the justification of that
knowledge, which will require us to imagine a incredible version of
reasoning to match.

This concern is exacerbated by Chisholm's suggestion that:
    (p.1.2) The alternatives to this view, once _they_ are clearly articulated
    may be seen to be at least problematic and to imply an extreme form of
    skepticism
which appears to set the stage for a false dichotomy between the <q>traditional
view</q> and skepticism (on the tacit assumption that if the <q>traditional
view</q> ain't true of it, then it ain't knowledge).

For my part, I am prepared to simply stipulate that anything that did not at
least sometimes, and to some extent, justify belief, is not reasoning at all.
Even further, I am prepared to stipulate that reasoning is a kind of
psychological process that some people go through/perform/enact/do from time to
time in which they either form new justified beliefs or come to see that old
beliefs are justified, without the gathering of additional empirical evidence.

Some philosopher's might take these stipulations to be definitional truths and
for my part I see no reason to deny them this harmless conceit; except insofar
as it might suggest I am claiming some deep insight into the nature or essential
features of the process of reasoning (perhaps gained by conceptual analysis or
by <q>coming to see what it is for a person to reason</q> as Chisholm might put
it).  Instead I am simply curious how something can be both a process that
beings such as ourselves can perform *AND* an apparently unempirical
justification of belief.

To put it another way, I accept that reasoning is a source of knowledge, and am
committed to asking: What sort of beings are we that we are capable of
reasoning? What kind of a process is reasoning that beings such as ourselves are
capable of doing it? But am more than willing to consider that previous
attempts to answer these questions may have laboured under false assumptions and
misguided constraints.

=== On inclusion and exclusion ===
    (p.2.1) The property of being square includes that of being rectangular, . .
    . [and] excludes that of being circular

Why focus on these "relationships" of inclusion and exclusion?

ALL squares are rectangles<br>
∀x [Square(x) -> Rectangle(x)]<br>

NO squares are circles<br>
not ∃x [Square(x) ∧ Circle(x)]<br>
which is interdeducible in FOL with<br>
∀x not [Square(x) ∧  Circle(x)]<br>

NOT ∃x NOT =interdeducible in classical First Order Logic with= ∀x<br>

So these are the two ways in which universal quantifiers can occur at the
beginning of a statement. Either immediately followed by a negation or not.  In
English one is more commonly expressed as a negative existential claim rather
than a positive universal claim. In this case the use of formalism enables us to
see that the distinction between these two forms is a kind of accident of the
English language. One can imagine a language with the same expressive
power(/inferential power/computational complexity) which did not have two
such distinct notations (i.e. a universal quantifier but no existential one or
vice versa).

The motivation for focusing on these general claims is straightforward:
knowledge of such claims is the most challenging to justify _a posteriori_.  It
may be that empirical observation can never justify absolute certainty about
anything, but it is surely the case that beliefs about our particular
surroundings (e.g. that I am typing on a computer at the moment) are justified
by our observations, and that those observations warrant a very high degree of
confidence in those beliefs. In the case of universal claims, however, the gap
between the confidence with which they are believed, and the confidence which
experience can justify in them appears more striking, and hence more difficult
for those who reject _a priori_ knowledge to explain.

Chisholm's motivation for framing these general claims as matters of the
<q>inclusion</q> and <q>exclusion</q> relationships between properties rather than as
simple universal claims is discussed in [[#Geometrical figures exist]].

The <q>challenge</q> is: how can reasoning be a process which justifies confidence in
such universal claims. Indeed so.

== Four reasons knowledge of some general truths must be _a priori_ ==
Chisholm offers roughly four reasons why our knowledge of some general truths
cannot be justified _a posteriori_ and hence must be justified a _priori_.
Unfortunately all of these arguments rely in one way or another upon the
following premise:

*Premise 1*<b> : Enumerative Induction is the only way of knowledge of general
truths can be justifed _a posteriori_</b>
    (p.2.2) "If [a general] truth were known _a posteriori_ then it would
    be justified by some induction or inductions"

For my own part I do not believe that any beliefs are justified by
induction any more than I believe that any beliefs are justified by the
intuitive apprehension of their necessity, but I do not want to get distracted
into a discussion of _a posteriori_ justification.  I take it that both Chisholm
and I are interested in whether or not some truths are known _a priori_, or by
reason alone, and hence that it would be beside the point to quibble about
whether there are various ways in which beliefs may be justified _a posteriori_
and what those various ways were.

I propose to simply grant, for the sake of argument, that all _a posteriori_
knowledge is justified by "enumerative induction" (or a combination of
enumerative induction and _a priori_ justification) provided, in turn, that I
may treat any clear example of a posteriori knowledge (e.g. the knowledge that
Earth's oceans contain a great deal of H,,2,,0) as justified, at least partly,
by "enumerative induction" and hence available as a counter-example to
Chisholm's various claims concerning the limits on the claims that may be
justified in this way.

=== 1. We know general truths that have no positive instances. ===
Chisholm claims that many people know that all squares are rectangles, and yet,
in the strict "geometrical sense" there never have been any squares (nor
rectangles) at all.

This argument combines [[#Premise 1|Premise 1]] above with two further premises

*Premise 2*<b> : The justification of of a universal claim by enumerative
induction requires perception of a number of positive instances of that
universal claim.</b>
        (p.2.4) there might be said to be three steps involved in an
        inductive justification . . . (1) the accumulation of instances
*Premise 3*<b> : We have knowledge of universal truths of which there are no
positive instances.</b>
        (p.3.1)  If we take 'square,' 'rectangular,' and 'circular' in the
        precise way in which these words are usually interpreted in geometry we
        must say that nothing is square, rectangular, or circular; . . . [yet we
        know that] "Necessarily, being square includes being rectangular and
        excludes being circular."
and concludes:<br>
<b>Our knowledge of these general truths is not justified _a posteriori_.</b>
    
==== 2nd premise false ====
The main defect in this argument is that <b>Premise 2</b> is false. Indeed
_a posteriori_ knowledge of universal truths that lack positive instances is
not unusual. Chemists, for example, may know quite well that a certain chemical
compound is highly toxic, without any instances of that compound ever having
existed. Indeed their knowledge that a compound is highly toxic may be one of
the reasons they decide not to synthesise that compound. (This example comes
from Fodor((I am not sure of the exact source, I suspect psychosemantics. Fodor raises it in connection with the notion of "causal kinds". The word "brisket" may occur within a page or two of the example.)) )

A proponent of _a priori_ knowledge might respond that we know that a
given chemical compound would be poisonous because we have _a posteriori_
knowledge of a variety of chemical principles concerning the elements from which
that non-existent poisonous compound is constructed (principles concerning
carbon atoms, electrons, protons and the like). Positive instances of those
principles *do* exist, our belief in *those* principles is justified by
"enumerative induction", and from those principles we can *deduce* (presumably
by inferences, known _a priori_ to preserve truth) that the compound in question
is poisonous.

Whether or not we rely upon _a priori_ knowledge of valid deductive inferences
to derive predictions from the principles of chemistry is important, but
irrelevant to the current point. For we never observe positive instances of the
principles governing these elementary components either. We have never observed
a molecular bond, nor an electron, nor a carbon atom (except in the derivative
sense that we have seen "lead" pencils and organic tissue). While there is scope
to argue over whether or not to count seeing animal tissue or the "lead" in lead
pencils as seeing carbon atoms, it is clear that there is no single repeated
observation, akin to the repeated observation of blue circles, which justifies
our knowledge that organic tissue is largely composed of carbon atoms. Instead
the atoms and the bonds between them are invoked to explain and predict a wide
range of things about which superficial observation is sufficient to establish
agreement.

Still, a proponent may fall back further, and conceed that our confidence in
chemical laws is not due to repeated observation of any individual rule being
fulfilled, but rather due to repeated observation of the predictions those laws
imply in combination with each other (_a priori_ if one will). It is the
positive instances of fulfilled predictions that provide the basis for the
enumerative induction justifying our belief in the theory as a whole.

The shift to holding that _a posteriori_ justification is a relationship
observations bear to whole theories, rather than (directly) to the individual
statements those theories contain, is one I wholeheartedly applaud. I am also
happy to agree that the _a posteriori_ support for these theories is based upon
their predictive success (even if I remain dubious about enumerative induction).
But note that while this defence does retain enumerative induction in some
sense, it no longer requires the observation of positive instances of general
principles for belief in those principles to be justified _a posteriori_.

(see [[#Geometrical figures exist]] in the draft notes below for a discussion
of [[#Premise 3]] and its relation to Chisholm's talk of "inclusion" and
"exclusion".)

=== 2. Unaware of performing induction ===
Before turning to Chisholm's strongest arguments for _a priori_ knowledge, we
should consider an extremely simple argument that is interwoven with the other
three but which Chisholm does not advance explicitly.  Once squarely considered,
the feebleness of this argument is readily apparent, but unless explicitly
acknowledged and set aside, it may have an undue influence on our
considerations.

The closest Chisholm comes to explicitly stating this argument is a sentence in
the midst of an extended (and seemingly approving) quotation from William
Whewell:
    (p.3.2) To learn a proposition by experience, and to see it to be
    necessarily true are two altogther different processes of thought.
The argument is simple: belief in "truths of reason" is not justified
_a posteriori_ because because we are not aware of justifying those beliefs by
enumerative induction (or any other form of _a posteriori_ justification). To
learn a belief in such a way is an "altogether different' thought process, and
since we are aware of our own thought processes, we are aware that these beliefs
are not justified by experience.

It is certainly true that we do not go around consciously "accumulating
instances" of general claims gradually increasing our confidence in those claims
as the number and variety of our observations increases. But equally clearly the
simple fact that we are not aware that our beliefs are justified by enumerative
induction does not imply that they are not justified in that way.

Infants and Dr Pavlov's dogs, for instance, certainly learn by induction without
being aware that they are doing so. But a proponent of the current argument
might maintain those believers are either insufficiently self-aware or 
do not understand the distinction between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_
justification. It might yet be thought that self-reflective creatures who are
aware of this justification, could not be confused as to how their own beliefs
were justified.

Sadly, even this last conceit has a multitude of counter-examples. Many
statements that are now held to be clearly justified _a posteriori_ (statements
such as "Unobstructed hot air rises", or "Solid objects near the Earth's
experience a force towards the Earth's center") were once thought to be
necessary truths justified by "intuitive induction". Indeed one aspect of the
"traditional view" that Chisholm fails to mention, is that it did not recognise
the distinction between physical necessity involved in causation and conceptual
necessity involved in claims such as "Necessarily no completely blue things are
completely red". Aristotle, the arch-proponent of the traditional view, and many
many of his followers held that knowledge of both these sorts of necessity was
justified by a leap of insight into the essential natures of the properties
involved. (This is perhaps the chief reason that he, and his followers, did not
draw a distinction between science((or empirical investigation under any other name)) and philosophy.)

As the ancient proponents of the traditional view exemplify, the most capable
and insightful minds may mistakenly hold their beliefs to be justified
_a priori_ (indeed justified by "intuitive induction") when if fact they are
justified by "enumerative induction" (or some for of _a posteriori_
justification at any rate). That we are unaware of the _a posteriori_
justification of our beliefs (inductive or otherwise) does not imply that they
are not so justified.

=== 3. Knowledge of necessity cannot be justified _a posteriori_ ===
Unfortunately Chilsholm does not so much present an argument for this
conclusion, as quote other people asserting it. Even then he appears to
vacillate in his assesment of how compelling this argument is. This is
particularly unfortunate since it is the strongest of the arguments for the
existence of _a priori_ knowledge.

Chisholm appears to be agreeing with William Whewell when he says:
    (p.3.6) William Whewell wrote that the mere accumulation of instances cannot
    afford the slightest ground for the necessity of a generalization upon those
    instances.  "Experience," he said, "can observe and record what has
    happened; but she cannot find, in any case, or in any accumulation of cases,
    any reason for what _must_ happen." 

But in the immediately preceding paragraph Chisholm claims merely that:
    (p.3.4) The step from the inductive generalisation "Every individual thing,
    past, present, and future, is such that if it is red then it is not blue"
    . . . to "Necessarily, every individual thing, past, present, and future,
    is such that if it is red then it is not blue" - remains obscure.
which suggests that he is open to the possibility that knowledge of necessary
truths can be justified _a posteriori_ after all. (Or "remains obscure" could be
philosopher code for "makes no sense").

But he repeatedly asserts that _a priori_ knowledge is knowledge of necessary
truths:
    (p.5.1) by contemplating or reflecting upon certain propositions or
    states of affairs, we will be able to see that they are necessary. This kind
    of knowledge has traditionally been called _a priori_.
    <br><br>
    (p.6.2) We may accept Kant's dictum, if we take it to mean that what is
    known a priori is necessary.
    <br><br>
    (p.2.3) These relations [of inclusion and exclusion] all hold necessarily.<br><br>
    (p.1.3) These truths [known _a priori_] pertain to certain abstract or
    eternal objects--things such as properties, numbers, and propositions or
    states of affairs, things that would exist even if there weren't any
    contingent things such as persons and physical objects.
    <br><br> 
    (p.7.1) If a man knows, or someone once knew, _a posteriori_ that a certain
    necessary proposition is true, then someone knows _a priori_ that some
    necessary proposition is true.

Chisholm may be underplaying his hand due to concern about the modern view that
statements such as "Water is H,,2,,O" or "Hesperus is Phosphorous" are both
necessarily true and known _a posteriori_.

Though Chisholm does not present any argument for this claim, there is a very
plausible reason why experience cannot justify knowledge of necessity:

==== If no experience can falsify then none can confirm ====
[:This section provides the first draft for
{[[if_some_experiences_confirm_others_must_infirm]]}:]
Consider an ordinary case - one looks out the window, sees droplets of some
liquid falling on the ground against an overcast sky, and forms the
(_a posteriori_) justified belief that it is raining. This justification relies
upon the fact that there are other experiences/observations one could have made
that would _infirm_ the claim that it is raining, such as seeing a bright blue
sky with no clouds and the sun shining.

If, by contrast, the different observations one could have made by looking out
the window, seeing falling droplets, seeing heavy mist, seeing a blue sky,
seeing an overcast sky etc., <b>all</b> confirmed the belief that it was
raining, then there would be no reason to look out the window at all. The belief
that it was raining would be justifiable _a priori_ (or at least prior to
looking out the window).

The matter can be put convincingly in the terminology of possible worlds. When
you observe droplets falling on the ground outside your window, you can exclude
the possibility that you are in a world where you do not make that observation.
Of course the observation might not be veridical, you might be hallucinating, or
even if there really are droplets falling outside your window it might be
because someone is secretly running a sprinkler system. However, one can be
confident that the real world is one of the possible worlds in which you have
the experience of seeing droplets.

If a lesser proportion(/density((the number of possible worlds, both compatible
and incompatible with the given observation, is presumably uncountable so normal
talk of number and ratio must be supplanted with terms suited to infinite sets
or we may simply talk of possible worlds in favour of probabilities)) ) of
possible worlds in which one does <b>not</b> observe droplets falling
outside your window are possible worlds in which it is raining, then once those
worlds are excluded, the set of remaining possible worlds (the ones compatible
with your observation) will contain a greater proportion of worlds in which it
<b>is</b> raining and hence the belief that it is raining will be, at least to
some extent, confirmed. In the limiting case <b>all</b> the worlds in which it
is not raining will be excluded and you will be justified in being certain that
it is raining.

The point is recognised, at least partially, in Popper's falsification
principle. For his part Popper, implausibly, did not recognise any form of
confirmation whatsoever. However he reserved the positive term "scientific" for
those theories which are infirmed by some courses of experience; with
unscientific theories either unworthy of belief or containing merely
definitional truths.

The matter is also expressible in terms of conditional probabilities. It is
connected with Bayes' theorem, and is a consequence of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability|Law of Total Probability]].



In the case of necessary truths however, no observation can exclude any
possible worlds in which a necessary truth is false (since there are none) and
hence no observation can justify an increase in the confidence with which a
necessary truth is believed. To put the matter in the terms of Bayes' theorem,
the probability of a observation/piece of evidence occuring given that a
necessary truth is true [P(e/n)], must be equal to the probability of that
evidence occuring at all [P(e)], and hence no evidence can give reason for
increasing the confidence of belief in a necessary truth.

(Note: that this principle also applies to the rigid designator necessities - in
that case there are both (possible) experiences confirming and infirming
"Hesperus = Phosphorous". There are none that would infirm "All squares are
rectangles" hence none that can confirm it.)

=== 4. Certainty cannot be justified _a posteriori_ ===
There is one last feature which, according to the "traditional view",
distinguishes truths knowable _a priori_, namely that they can be known with
certainty.

Chisholm is clearly committed to this aspect of the traditional view:
    (p.5.4) We might say, therefore, that an a priori proposition is one such
    that, if you accept it, then it becomes certain for you. 

He also claims that "axioms" or _a priori_ first principles are known with
certainty:
    (p.5.5) h is an axiom =Df h is necessarily such that (i) it is true and (ii)
    for every S, if S accepts h, then h is certain for S.
and goes on to define "known _a priori_ by S" as deduced from axioms S knows with
certainty by rules of inference S knows with certainty to preserve truth.

This commitment to certainty also makes sense of Chisholm's otherwise quite
curious argument:
    (p.3.4) application of induction would seem to presuppose a knowledge of the
    "truths of reason." In setting out to confirm an inductive hypothesis, we
    must be able to recognize what its consequences would be. Ordinarily, to
    recognize these we must apply deduction; we take the hypothesis along with
    other things that we know and we see what is then implied. All of this, it
    would seem, involves apprehension of truths of reason
This argument, which otherwise appears to be a non-sequitur, becomes quite
straightforward on the tacit assumption that all (justification transmitting)
inferences must be underpinned by truths known with certainty. (i.e. to
justifiably infer that "The ball is not red all over" from "The ball is green
all over" requires knowing with certainty that "Nothing is both red and green
all over"; and even merely probable inferences such as to infer "Tomorrow it
will rain" from "The sky was red this morning and it become very overcast"
requires the certain knowledge that "If the sky is red in the morning and
becomes very overcast during the day it is likely to rain the next day.")

Whether or not this assumption underpins Chisholm's argument for his claim that
"application of induction would seem to presuppose a knowledge of 'truths of
reason'", it is clear that Chisholm holds that we know at least some (and
perhaps all) "truths of reason" with certainty (if we known them at all). This
makes it all the stranger that he does not explicitly mention this as a reaosn
for believing in _a priori_ knowledge when the arguments showing that certainty
cannot be justified _a posteriori_ are so clear and so well known.

==== two arguments ====
On a more or less Bayesian account of justification  (as [[#If no experience can falsify then none can confirm|outlined above]])
according to which experiences confirm beliefs by virtue of excluding "possible
worlds" in which the believing subject does not have those experiences. If it is
possible for a general claim to be true at all (or rather if the initial
creedence with which such a claim is believed is non-zero) then no sequence of
observations, no enumerative induction, can ever reduce the justified creedence
of the claim to zero. For any N, if it is possible for green fizzy drinks to
taste either delicious or awful at all, then there is at least one possible
world in which the first N-1 green fizzy drinks taste awful and the Nth is
delicious.

Those who take necessity more seriously than I, might draw much the same
conclusion from Hume's dictum "no connexions among distinct existences are
ever discoverable by human understanding." (p.400.1
[[local:zz.texts/hume1739-treatiseHumanNature.pdf|Treatise]]). Provided a
general claim is not already known to be true with absolute certainty, no
observation can justify becoming absolutely certain about that claim. For there
is no (knowable) necessary connection between my experience and the truth of
some non-necessary general claim, and without such a connection it remains
possible that one might have that experience and yet the general claim be false.

Chisholm's failure to mention possession of certain knowledge as grounds for
believing in _a priori_ knowledge becomes easily understood, however, once we
realise that Chisholm is keenly aware, and deeply concerned with the
difficulties this claim of certainty gives rise to.

==== Chisholm's concern with skepticism ====
The only criticism of the "traditional view" that Chisholm considers, is
the skeptical concern that "the intuitive apprehension of certain relations
holding between properties" (and, no doubt, the "like relations" of inclusion
and exlusion between) is not a guarantee that those relations obtain (and hence
that the relevant "truth of reason" is true at all):

    (p.7.1)<br>
    1: You cannot know that a given proposition is axiomatic for you unless the
       proposition is one such that, when you contemplate it, you have a kind of
       experience - say, a strong feeling of conviction that provides you with a
       guarantee that the proposition is true. But<br>
    2: there is no experience which will provide such a guarantee. Therefore<br>
    3: you cannot really know, with respect to any proposition that it is one
       that is axiomatic.

The skeptic in this case is simply playing back Chisholm's own prejudice that
all knowledge requires deduction from a combination of _a priori_ principles
known with certainty, tentative generalisations justified by enumerative
induction and particular observations.  A less committed soul than Chisholm
might take this to be an internal contradiction in his epistemology; but
Chisholm remains so wedded to his epistemology that in order to save it he is
willing to carve out an exception.

In order to deny a premise of this argument (it is not entirely clear which
one) Chisholm invokes the notion of a self-presenting state:
    
    (p.8.2) And so what of the skeptic's question, "How do you know that the
    proposition that 2 and 4 are 6 is one that is axiomatic?" Let us recall what
    we said in connection with his earlier question about self-presenting
    states. The question was: "How do you know that seeming to have a headache
    is a self-presenting state?" In dealing with that question, we avoided
    falling into the skeptic's trap. We said that the only possible answer to
    such a question is that we _do_ know that seeming to have a headache is
    self-presenting state. We should follow a similar course in the present
    case.

It is unclear if Chisholm intends to claim that the certain knowledge that 2 + 4
= 6 is self-presenting, or merely that we have to know it in order for his
epistemology to hold water.  In either case his motivation is clear. Chisholm
needs there to be no epistemic gap between 2 + 4 = 6 being true, and our
believing it to be so - either by maintianing that the apprehension of the
necessity of 2 + 4 = 6 is not a kind of experience but rather simply a piece of
knowledge directly vouchsafed to us, or by maintaining that this intuitive
apprehension of necessity is self-intimating.

Neither option is appealing. Headache's may be self-presenting, in the sense
that if you feel you have one then you do; but merely believing a truth to be
necessary and it actually <b>being</b> necessary are two altogether differrent
things.

=== My way or the highway: opening up other alternatives ===
Two factors drive Chisholm into the false dichotomy between his epistemology and
skepticism:

==== first epistemology ====
The first is a commitment to "first epistemology". Chisholm assumes from the
outset that a belief is justified only if we can first set limits to the range
of possibilities (by apprehending _a priori_ axioms) and deriving further
other _a priori_ knowledge from those axioms, and combining both with _a
posteriori_ knowledge of our experiences to narrow the range of possibilities
that might actually be realised.

To the degree that it remains <b>possible</b> that one is wrong, one is not
justified in holding a belief. Of course, Chisholm no doubt holds that none but
"truths of reason" can be known with absolute certainty, but the degree of
confidence with which a belief is justified is the degree to which the <b>
possibility</b> of error has been eliminated.  If one cannot even discern the
limits of possibility, one feels Chisholm worrying, how can one justify any
belief at all?

The alternative on this front is to abandon the hope of a "first epistemology"
and accept that there is no higher arbiter of truth than our own _a posteriori_
theories of the world. For a belief to be justified by some evidence on this
account (whether that evidence is conceived of as experiences, stimuli,
instrument readings, or tracks in the snow) is simply for that evidence to be
unlikely to occur unless the belief in question is true *according to our
current best _a posteriori_ theory.

Chisholm, and other first epistemologists worry, no doubt, that this makes the
project circular. That any theory is justified by its own lights. But it is
surprisingly common for this not to be so. Our theories of langauge, with their
sentence meanings and determinate translations, for example posit entities for
which no evidence can be obtained. So to the positing of essences and essential
properties. We propose theories which, if true, we would have no way of knowing.

There is a circle here, but it is virtuous rather than vicious, the goal is no
make our theories internally consistent - to make them, by their own lights,
theories that we could have evidence for believing. To close this circle and
make our theories,  by their own lights, ones which we have evidence for
beliving, is the valuable and productive role of epistemology.

(It is worth noting that Chisholm's own epistemology is an example of a theory
that by its own lights is unknowable.)

===== accepting introspective accounts at first value =====
The second key mistake is Chisholm's insistance that the "apprehension of
necessity" be taken at face value. That doing so is simply a pre-requisite of
doing epistemology at all:
    (p.3.3) If anyone does not clearly comprehend this distinction of necessary
    and contingent truths, he will not be able to go along with us in our
    researches into the foundations of human knowledge; nor indeed, to pursue
    with success any speculation on the subject.

and that to question this assessment is to plunge into skepticism. Tp:
    (p.8.3) sacrifice the clearest and most lucid knowledge that we
    possess-indeed, the only knowledge that is clear and lucid per se.

Behind the vehemence lurks the awareness that the only reason for the continued
grip of the "traditional view" is the belief that what we are sensing when we
contemplate putative "truths of reason" is necessity. This is simply another
aspect of the paralysing effect of building our psychological theories on the
basis of introspection (see [[introspection]]).

= necessity and _a priority_ are elements of an explanation =
A starting point for beginning to free ourselves of the "traditional view"
explanations of what it is that our intuitive sense is an intuitive sense of is
to realise the plain truth that the idea that we are responding to necessity and
a priority is a <u>*diagnosis*</u> or <u>*explanation*</u> of what we sense when
we consider "truths of reason".  The claim that the distinctive feeling aroused
by "truths of reason" is the "apprehension of necessity" is not itself something
that is intrinsic to this feeling itself. As wittgenstein put it

The key point, is one of the theme's of wittgenstein's later philosophy.
    (Phil. Inv. c.580) "an 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria
To put the matter in more prosaic terms (and avoid Wittgenstein's unfortunate
notion of a criterion) One's awareness of ones inner states doesn't come with

We invoke the notion that introspective sensation is an "apprehension of
necessity" to explain, among other things, our ability to reliably, and in rough
agreement with our peers, sort novel truths into the two categories which the
traditional account describes as necessary and contingent.  The ability to so
sort does suggest that there is something about these sentences which we are
responding to, it does require an explanation of some sort, but it does *not* in
and of itself require us to accept any one particular explanation of this
ability; let alone require us to grant that what we are responding to in these
statements is their being necessarily true.

Most of us are taught these traditional diagnoses in primary school, at such a
young age that few of us recall the learning process.  For my own part I have
witnessed my own children in 3rd grade being taught how to use the terms
"possible", "impossible" and "necessary" by example.  (Sample statements I
witnessed the teacher using to teach students correct use of the words
"possible" and "impossible": "1 + 1 = 3 - no not possible, "Tomorrow we go to
the shops - yes thats possible", Interestingly enough, "Tomorrow the sun will
rise in the west - no that's impossible".) The situation closely resembled
Chisholm's fantasy of enumerative induction.

We are trained in the application of the terms "possible" and "impossible" to
various statements and taught that certain applications of these terms are
correct and others are incorrect. The intuitive/felt distinction of these
statements comes first, then a term for applying to the statements that arouse
this felt difference, and then we are given an theory of what that feeling is a
feeling of. The truth of the theory is *_NOT_* vouchsafed by the felt
distinction of which it is an attempted explanation.

It made perfect sense, two and a half thousand years ago, to the ancient
original geometer proponents, that in the midst of a chaotic world, when the
geometrical predictions they made on the basis of these intuitions were not only
correct, but the most reliably and verifiably correct of all the predictions
they made (with astronomy coming a close second); that the intuitive sense they
had of these truths was one which gave them absolute certainty. Their
explanation of that certainty required that those truths were necessary, and 
they erected a metaphysics of forms and properties to 

We have erected an edifice on the explanation of an introspective intuition.
The thing that prevents us, more than anything else, from moving beyond this
ancient theory is the paralysing effect of treating the diagnosis of our
introspective awareness as an observation. Here as elsewhere the effect of
basing our theories on introspective evidence is to make them impervious to
change. (see [[introspection]]).

==== below this point is still rough notes ====
== points to be explained ==
[:this provides the first draft for [[features_of_supposed_analytic_truths]]
Hopefully it is now at least plausible that the "traditional view" is not
something that is simply given to us in introspection, but rather an
explanation of what introspective awareness is awareness of.

Let us turn to clarifying, in the third person, what it is that requires
explaination. For the purpose of avoiding the presumption (and avoiding
tediously repeated use of the term "putative truth of reason") let us call the
statements that people catagorise with "truths of reason" N-statememnts, and
thew others C-statements.

==== 1. "truths of reason" reliably discernable ====
People can reliably, more or less consistently and more or less in agreement
with each other categorise novel statements into N-statements and C-statements.

There is a felt difference *OF SOME KIND* between supposedly necessary truths
known _a priori_ and contingent truths known _a posteriori_

==== 2. "truths of reason" believed with great confidence ====
As we saw earlier the claim that "truths of reason" (or at least those that are
"axioms") are known with certainty leads to significant difficulties.

The "feeling of confidence we have need not be taken at face value either. It
may be that our feeling of greatest confidecne falls 

Furthermore we need not take this inner sense of confidence at face value:
    (Phil. Inv. c.579) A feeling of confidence. How is it manifested in
    behaviour?

By Bayesian standards absolute confidence entails that no further evidence could
ever lead to a change of mind. If something is known with certainty, then there
is no evidence on which conditionalisation will lead 
conditionalisation on any evidenceone is only absolutely confident if there is no evidence
that could alter ones mind. 

On a more prosaic level people check their reasoning multiple times. It is not
unusual to have this feeling, and then (say if people's lives depend upon it) to
go and check one's working again. 

From my father - on first learning a theroem - sy that internal angles of
triangle = 180 then go and check multiple times. Then feel confident.

It is true however, that people will place bets at very low odds on these
claims.

So we may remain unconvinced that people are absoolutely certain of these
beliefs but is is the case that they are very highly confident in them.

The vast majority of people (perhaps everyone?) who class a statement as a
N-statement also have very high (but perhaps not absolute) confidence in that
statements truth.

Indeed the puzzling thing is how much we continue to trust this sense. We have
all been led astray by our reasoning from time to time. WHy is it that we
continue to trust so certainly?

((In any case [[descartes]] notoriously proclaimed the sentence "I exist", to be
known same certainty as any putatively necessary truth, but surely that sentence
is not necessarily true. So while any satisfactory explanation would have to
Though in that case it is the felt necessity of the claim that "If I am doubting
my own existence then I exist" ))

==== 3. unable to imagine falsehood of "truths of reason" ====
In the opposite direction people who put (or are disposed to put if asked) a
statement into the group traditionally diagnosed as necessary are nearly always
incapable of describing situations in which such sentences would be false, or of
evidence which would lead them to reduce their confidence in those sentences.

When I try to imagine the negation of a supposed "truth for reason"; for example
when I try to imagine a square that is not a rectangle, or a square that is a
circle, or something that is red all over and blue all over, I do not know what
to do. I "get nothing", am lost, cannot imagine what it would be like. Other
people describe their feelings in similar terms. They cannot generally draw
pictures of a situation in which that sentence is true (literal pictures, not
game of charades style instructions for assembling the sound or shape of the
words forming the sentence).  Furthermore they are at a loss when asked what
evidence they would accept as justification for holding such a claim to be true.

==== 4. unable to describe infirming evidence ====
Furthermore people are often at a loss to describe
the evidence which would lead them to sincerely deny
sentences arousing this.

The inability to describe/imagine/depict evidence that would lead
one to hold them as false is not unique to "truths of reason".

For my own part I cannot imagine any evidence which would lead me to accept as
true the claim that no black dogs have ever existed.  (No sequence of
stimulations of my sensory surfaces will lead from my current state to a state
in which I deny "There have not been black dogs." There are doubtless sequences
which would lead to me dying, others which would lead to me going insane, and
some very unpleasant sequences that would lead to me pretending to believe [aud
loudly declaiming to the torturer] that there have never been black dogs, but no
sequence of observations, experiments, lines of argument or other considerations
that could ever lead me to honestly deny the past existence of black dogs.)

==== 5. high confidence often justified ====
Finally, but perhaps most importantly, I also maintain my initial 
agreement with Chisholm that _*Reason is a source of knowledge*_. i.e. that
people not only _feel_ confident about the sentences which arouse this feeling
in them, at least a great deal of the time, _this confidence is justified_.

But note that this need not be an account where it is impossible, 

Any explanation of that omitted to explain why our belief in "truths of reason"
is actually justified (and not merely why we feel that it is justified) would be
liable to lead to skepticism as Chisholm claims. ???? the skepticism that
CHisholm feels must affect 
(p.8.1 "we do have the knowledge in question, and therefore, any philosophical
theory")

Our theory must explain why our belief in "truths of reason" is justified, but
as was suggested above[[#necessity and a priority are elements of an explanation]]

we don't need to achieve justification of absolute certainty. For I take it that
such certainty could only be justified

We *do* have to explain why people feel such confidence in those truths they
take to be "truths of reason", and we *do* have to explain why that 

How it would be
impossible for someone to believe that and yet for it to be false.
necessary

Indeed as we shall see in the [[#many false statements have evoked intuition|next section]]
any explanation which held that this feeling either itself justified, or was an
awareness of a process which justified

== The "traditional view" a bad explanation ==
Now that we have established what it is that we wish to explain, hopefully we
will be why Chisholm's "traditional view" is such a *bad* explanation of these
phenomena.

==== many false statements have evoked intuition ====
Many statements that aroused this distinctive sense
true distinctive
feeling (which has in the European intellectual tradition at least, been
supposed to be aroused by necessary and a priori truths/truths of reason,) in
the highest degree and in the keenest minds  was
aroused in the keenest minds of humanity by statement that later turned out to
be false.  The claim that a single line passes through any two distinct points
or, the internal angles of a right angle triangle sum to two right angles,
excited precisely this same intuition. One could save the intuition by saying
that these did not _really_ arouse this intuition at all, they aroused some
simulacra, a "mere feeling", which was phenomenologically indistinguishable but
not a mark of the same necessity and a priority at all.  That what we are
sensing in the case of "1 + 1 = 2" or "No square is a circle" is *NECESSITY*
(and not to be doubted) wheras what Kant was sensing in the law of casuality
(that nothing happens for no reason, or happens differently for no reason) was
mere over-confidence or prejudice. But even this 

ALthough Chisholm is somewhat careful to avoid talking about it a further part
of the "traditional view" as held by Aristotle, was that natural causation 
Causation was felt to arouse this same kind of 


For if in the calse of Euclidean geometry, this feeling *had* justified
certainty (and bear in mind that not only did theorems of Euclidean but they
were the prime exemplars of "truhts of reason" and pardigmatic examples of the
statements arousing this feeling).
Then it oulwd have been impossible for people to have this feeling and for thsoe
statements to have been false. But, to put it breifly, they did and they were.

Any theory according to which this feeling was a certain
guarante of truth would be a _bad_ explanation, because as mentioned above this
and has been aroused by sentences which are clearly false. A plausible
explanation must explain how it was possible for this feeling to lead us
astray, and not merely as a matter of confusion, or a mistake made by the very
brightest minds FOR CENTURIES, that they simply misdiagnosed this feeling, or
misunderstood the sentences the sentences that aroused this feeling in them
under the very best conditions, when they were thinking at their clearest, 

Nor are the truths of geometry the only truths which according to the
traditional proponents.

==== not all "truths of reason" evoke intuition ====
Chisholm distinguishes between <b>Axioms</b>, which are known with certainty
once they are understood, and 
This is perhaps the point on which Chisholm comes closest to an outright
contradicting himself.

At the end of the section in which 

    (p.5.3) We might say, therefore, that an _a priori_ proposition is one such
    that, if you accept it, then it becomes certain for you. (For if you accept
    it, then you understand it, and as soon as you understand it, it becomes
    certain for you.) 

but then he immediately goes on to say that this account

    (p.5.4) This account of the a priori, however, would be somewhat broad. We
    know some a priori propositions on the basis of others and these
    propositions are not themselves such that, once they are understood, then
    they are certain.


But there is no explanation of _why_ some "truths of reason" are Axiom
Just why do some "truths of reason" evoke this sense of certainty and others do
not.

One tempting explanation is failure to understand, perhaps becasue the statement
in question is too complex:
(p.6.1) "Failure to accept their conjunction need not be a sign that S[ubject] is unrea-
sonable. It may be a sign merely that the conjunction is too complex an object
for S[ubject] to grasp."

Fermat's last theorem, there is no n greater than 2 and A, B, C such that
A^n^ + B^n^ = C^n^ . For over 350 years this sentence did not arouse the
intuition of necessity, perhaps it still does not and it . For my own part

ridiculous to suppose that the proposition was not understood

we granted in [[#1. "truths of reason" discernable|the first point to be explained]] above that most
people could consistently distinguish "truths of reason"

But it is worth noting that people are not in perfect agreement.
Firstly reasoning is a process where one can get 

many necessarily true sentences do not arouse this feeling, but perhaps in those

It appears to be only simple necessary truths that arouse this intuition.
Now it is quite clear that it is only quite simple "truths of reason" that evoke
this feeling of "seeing that it must be true".

Why is it that some quite simple and perfectly well understood statements evoke
this intuition when they are contemplated and others do not is left utterly
mysterious.

Nor is this a minor point, the real puzzle concerns how reasoning
justifies belief, and the point is that contemplation of some sentences, and
paricular reasoning to them 
We are offered no explanation of why some putatively necessary truths
arouse this feeling and this sense of certainty (and hence are eligible to stand
as axioms)

but this difficulty makes a nonsense of the process of reasoning
no explanartion offered of why reasoning (whihc Chisholm sometimes cales
"contemplating" or "reflecting upon") leads a statement to arouse

==== seeing what it is to have a property, not explanatory ====
Finallh
On this point In any case Chisholm certainly does not provide any account of how
it is that we "see" necessary truths, and I to present an account of how the non
traidtional account explains the vagueness of 

It is true that in several places Chisholm does _talk_ as if he has given a
different explanation of how belief in "truths of reason" may be justified. He
sometimes says things like "we come to see what it is for a thing to have the
property of being human" (p.3.5), and "by contemplating or reflecting upon
certain propositions or states of affairs we will be able to see that they are
necessary" (p.5.1-2), but it is worth noting that this is no explanation at all.
This traditional "explanation" of knowledge of "a priori truths" is so widely
promulgated, and has such a long-standing history of authoritative support (in
the European philosophical tradition) that it is easy to become innured to just
how bad an explanation it is. The poverty of this explanation can, however, be
brought to attention by transferring it to a different subject matter.

Suppose, that an architect were to come up to you and tell you that your house
was on the verge of imminent collapse

Just seeing that is must be so is not an explanation, but rather the lack of
one. It is where explanations come to an end. If you don't accept that then I
don't know how to help you.

the assumption that the only alternative to deduction from first principles and
sensation, is induction from first principles and sensation seems to be the
result of Chilsholm's atomism and foundationalism. By atomism I mean the
assumption that the units of justification (the fundamental entities that are
justified by some combination of experience and reasoning [whatever the latter
is, recall 

= Towards an alternative explanation =
It seems unfair not to venture at least a sketch of an alternative explanation
for the phenomena outlined above (in [[#points to be explained]]). It is easy to
criticise another's theories

Before attempting to venture an alternative explanation however, I would like to
emphasize, that even if the alternative I offer is hopeless
it does not make Chisholm's "explanation" any better. It would be far better and
more honest to simply say we do not know what is distinctive about these
statements nor how we are aware of that distinctive property, nor how our belief
in them is justified. This need not lead to skepticism, 

== Two fundamental errors in Chisholm's "traditional view" ==
=== semantic atomism ===

If one holds that each statement must stand on its own, that there must be some
chain of reasoning

The well-known analogy of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat|Neurath's boat<sup>ext</sup>]]

it seems to me that this also dispenses with supposed need for induction.
In this sense the justification of statments never comes up. For there is no
sense in which belief in a statement is justified. Rather the question is
_given_ that I believe

    (p.3.3) If anyone does not clearly comprehend this distinction of necessary
    and contingent truths, he will not be able to go along with us in our
    researches into the foundations of human knowledge; nor indeed, to pursue
    with success any speculation on the subject.

=== an awful argument ===
    (p.5.3) An axiom [According to Aristotle] is a statement "which has no other
    proposition prior to it"; there is no proposition which is "better known"
    than it is. We could say that if one proposition is "better known" than
    another, then accepting the one proposition is more reasonable than
    accepting the other. Hence, if an axiomatic proposition is one such that no
    other proposition is better known than it is, then it is one that is
    certain. 
Equivocates betwene holding a statement true without inferring it from another
and holding it with certainty. Simply awful.

==== No necessary connection between distinct existences ====
The first argument is one that a modal realist such as Chisholm might advance.
The simplest version of this argument is merely to note that our senses are
fallible. Descartes infamously argued that there is no necessary connection
between our sensations and external reality, that instead of perceiving chairs
tables and so on we could be dreaming, hallucinating or our senses manipulated
by a deceitful demon.

On a more prosaic level, from time to time each of us misperceives our
surroundings. We see flashes of light, which are normally caused by external
light sources, but which are caused by internal physiological events. We see
faces and human figures which turn out to be chance arrangements of bushes,
twigs and other random detritus. It is, in short, possible for us to see pink
elephants when no pink elephants exist.

On a more general level Hume famously argued that argued that "no connexions
among distinct existences are ever discoverable by human
understanding"((_Treatise_,  Appendix, para. 20)) and hence that there is no
"just conclusion from the existence or qualities of our perceptions to the
existence of external continu’d objects"((_Treatise_, Book 1.4, para. 54)).

If we are not justified in believing a truth to be necessary independent of our
experiences, then the having of an experience cannnot justify believing that
truth to be necessary as there is no necessary connection between our having
that experience and that truth obtaining. It would, as far as we know, be
possible for us to have that experience and the statement in question to yet be
false. (And for those statements that are necessary consequences of our having
that experience, such as "There are experiences", our experience itself does not
necessarily exist, and hence cannot establish that those consequences are
necessary.)

One defect of this argument is that it Argument relies upon principles
concerning necessity and for my part I know of no method for resolving disputes
concerning such principles (though philosophers such as Chisholm claim to be
able to do so). The next argument, however, relies only upon principles
concerning justification.

=== Geometrical figures exist ===
This section was intended to go at the end of
[[#1. We know general truths that have no positive instances.]]

Another, significant but slightly tangential, point of disagreement with
Chisholm's "traditional view" concerns [[#Premise 3|Premise 3]].  While
Premise 3 is true, the reason Chisholm gives for believing it (viz., that
"nothing is square, circular or rectangular" (p.3.1) ) reflects a deeper
disagreement about what makes these claims true.

Chisholm describes geometrical properties such as being square, circular etc.,
as uninstantiated Platonic forms. Knowledge of these forms(/properties) being
gained by _a priori_ investigations (since, to pre-empt the third argument, the
relations between these properties hold necessarily). By contrast, on the view I
advocate geometrical figures are regarded as posits of our empirical theories.
Akin to atoms, quarks and photons, and like them in playing a role in predicting
our observations, or being by-products of the elements of our theories which do
play such a role.

On Chisholm's account the statements: "All squares are triangles", "The sum of
the magnitude of the internal angles of any trangle is zero degrees", "The
length of the hypotenuse of any right angle triangle is equal to the length of
one of that triangles other sides" are all strictly true. (Indeed any sentence
of the form "All [instances of geometrical shape] are . . ." will be true.) This
is not absolutely devastating since he can re-interpret these sentences as
expressing the falsehoods "Being square includes being triangular", "The
property of being the sum of the internal angles of a triangle includes the
property of having zero magnitude" etc., but it means that ordinary use of
general claims such as "All squares are rectangles" must be regarded as
ambiguous; sometimes used to express a relation of inclusion/exclusion between
properties and sometimes used to express a plain general truth. While for his
part, Chisholm is forced to the artifical terminology of "inclusion" and
"exclusion" in order to state the unvarnished truth that not all squares are
circles without contradicting himself.

On the view advocated here, the statements "All squares are rectangular" and
"All squares are circular" are both taken at face value, and as true and false
respectively. Hence there must be some rectangular non-circular squares.

If space were Euclidean (a traditional commitment of the "traditional view"
whose falsity provides [[????|a difficulty for Chisholm's view]]) then squares and
circles would exist in physical space even though no arrangement of atoms would
be perfectly(/geometrically) circular(/square/rectangular). To borrow an example
from Quine((in _Truth by Convention_, though he does not make the caveats
concerning non-Euclidean physical space that are made here)) the statement "The
whole of a baseball apart for a certain very thin, irregular peripheral layer
constitutes a sphere", would be true even though no baseball was spherical.
Furthermore, the perimeter of any flat slice of the largest such sphere
contained in a given baseball is a circle.  Likewise the line from the point
near the center of the earth at which there is zero gravity to the point near
the center of the sun where there is zero gravity, would exist. As would the
sphere around the Sun of which that line is a radius and an infinite number of
squares of which that line is one side.

According to our current best scientific theories, however, physical space is
not Euclidean and hence there are no squares in physical space, however the
axioms of Euclidean geometry can be interpreted as true of collections of tuples
of real numbers (numbers which are themselves postulated in our _a posteriori_
empirical theories and are existent objects in good standing).

==== a connection to vagueness ====
The underlying difficulty is that the term square (in ordinary
usage, and without postulating any special "geometrical interpretation" of the
term) is somewhat vague. For each clear instance of a square there is a surrounding
penumbra of borderline cases - possible things that are neither clearly square
nor not square.  (Just as for each bald man we are able to
describe/depict/imagine a penumbra of slightly more hairy men who are neither
quite bald nor hirsute.)

Furthermore competent speakers commonly vary this penumbra, and adjust the
strictness of the range of objects of which they hold "square" to be true to fit
their purposes of the moment. For example, for the purposes of baking a cake a
given tin may count as square. A baker might without hesitation or confusion ask
for and receive a square cake tin from the assistnt baker, and if for some
reason the matter qere further questioned both baker and assistant would respond
confidently and affirmatively to the question "Is that the square tin?". For the
purpose of guiding the cutting of tiles, however, that very same tin might not
count as square. Looking for a jury-rigged method for cutting square tiles
(perhaps because the right tools had been left on the other truck) the tile
layer might reject that tin on the basis that "It is not square". Nor, equally
might that tin (or any other count as squae for the purposes of advancing
geo=metrical arguments

This phenomena is well recognised as presenting a serious difficulty for the
"traditional view" Chisholm is advocating. It seems to me to be far more

That that even _prima facie_ sharp terms such as "square" are vague, is even
more of a problem for the "traditional view" which Chisholm advocates than it is
the alternatives.

Positive instabnces have a penumbra of possible instances of which the predicate
in quesiton is neither quite true or false.

we can and do as a matter of course adjust our
standards of what counts as a square You can't fit a square peg through a round
hole.

It is perhaps, interesting that many native English speakers first learn to use
the term "square" by observing experienced English speakers conspicuously
applying the term to conspicuous squares, and (hopefully) being warmly
encouraged when, in turn, they are witnessed applying the term to discernable
squares themselves (see [[epistemic_triangle_of_language_learning]]). Then go on
to learn a variety of different standards by which objects of various different
types are correctly judged to be square (or not); one standard by which cakes
are correctly judged to be square or not, another by which kitchen tiles are
correctly judged square or not, and so on. And somewhere along the line, learn a
standard of squareness so stringent that none of the exemplars from which they
originally learnt the term "square" count as square by that standard at all.

But rather than being led to believe that people have some unempirical source
of knowledge concerning what the property expressed by "square" (under the
"geomterical interpretation") excludes and includes, consideration of the fact
that many people learn to use the term "square" in this way 
leads me to doubt that terms such as "square" function by
expressing properties at all; for it seems equally unsatisfactory to hold the
term "square" to be either syncategorematic (i.e. to occur in the unstructured
terms "square-cake" and "square-tile" in the same way that "cat" occurs in
"catapult") or ambiguous (i.e. to have a different meaning in application to
cakes than in application to kitchen tiles).

====== ambiguity unacceptable because: ======
and the ability to correctly categorise objects under novel composite categories
(i.e. the ability, having learnt what a square, square tile to go on without
further training or instruction to correctly distinguish square tables from
non-square tables) seems to me to be exactly what the postulation of concepts
was meant to explain. Grasping the relevant concept allowed one to correctly
assess, without being trained on each particular case,

===== syncategoratic unacceptable because: =====
since having learnt to distinguish square-tins, square-cakes, and
square-tiles, many of us are able to distinguish square-tables
without further training it would be deeply contrary to the "traditional
view" for square to fail to express a distinct "concept"(/"property")concept
which contributed to the the meanings of such compound terms.
