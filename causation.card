Are there causal relationships between events/objects/processes and what
distinguishes them from mere regularities.

Russell claimed that <q>in advanced sciences such as gravitational astronomy,
the word 'cause' never occurs,</q>(([[local:zz.texts/russell1917-mysticismAndLogic.pdf|_On the Notion of Cause_]])) and that <q>the word "cause" is so
inextricably bound up with misleading associations as to make its complete
extrusion from the philosophical vocabulary desirable</q>. i.e. Our best
theories of the world do not contain any term that might be translated into
English as <q>cause</q>.

Why causal roles? Odd. does the rejection of causality, suggest a wider version
of functionalism.

Of course this is related to qualia because qualia are supposed to be
epiphenomenal - having no _causal_ effect on physical states/systems.

:my-thesis:presentable: <br>
I agree with Russell's claim in [[local:zz.texts/russell1917-mysticismAndLogic.pdf|_On the Notion of Cause_]] that causation is an
obsolete notion that can be dropped from our theories of the world. In modern
jargon this appears to be what David Lewis means by a <q>Humean</q> view of
causation.

=== Russell's argument from contiguity ===
In [[local:zz.texts/russell1917-mysticismAndLogic.pdf|_On the Notion of Cause_]] Russell claims that causes must be temporally
contiguous with their effects. For if they are not, then there is some interval
between causes and effects and <q>However short we make the interval, something
may happen during this interval which prevents the expected result.</q>

Hence the cause in question does not <q>necessitate</q> its effects and is
therefore not the 'total' cause (i.e. it does not completely determine the
effect). But if time is continuous then no two moments in time are contiguous.
For any two instants in the same continuous time stream (in special relativity
this would be a set of space-time points that are simultaneous from some
inertial reference frame) there is a determinate time interval between them. If
that interval is 0 seconds then the two instants are identical. If the interval
between them is not 0 seconds then, since time is continuous, it contains an
infinite number of instants, and hence the original two instants are not
contiguous.

If we add that no causal influence can propagate faster than a fixed speed (such
as the speed of light) then action at a distance is prohibited, and much the
same argument applies to spatial contiguity.

Of course time _intervals_ may still be contiguous, provided one is an open and
the other a closed set of time instants (at the boundary between them). For
instance the set of instants _t_ such that 1:59am<=_t_<=2am and the set of instants
such that 2am<_t_<=2:01am are contiguous. But Russell notes that it is <q>too
strange to be accepted, in spite of bare logical possibility â€” that the cause,
after existing placidly for some time, should suddenly explode into the effect,
when it might just as well have done so at any earlier time, or have gone on
unchanged without producing its effect.</q> This claim can be somewhat refined 
if we reject action at a distance. If we take the rejection of action at a
distance to be 
Whatever effect a distant object/point/event/instant has must be
mediated through intermediate.

We, can for instance imagine, gradually heating up a sealed can until it
ruptures. Although the heating up process 

Let us return then to the first horn of Russell's dilemma. Russell's reasoning
doesn't quite go through in any system (such as those of special or general
relativity) in which space and time are continuous and there is a finite maximum
speed at which causal signals/effects/influences propagate.

Consider the sphere(:or N-dimensional hypersphere, if we are considering a space of N dimensions rather than just 3:) of points in space and time which are _T_ time units
prior to a given point _P_, and less than or equal to _T_ times the maximum
speed of causal propagation space units away from _P_. (In special relativity
this will be the intersection of a set of simultaneous(:from some perspective:) space-time points
and _P's_ past light cone.) Nothing can come from outside this sphere to
<q>prevent the expected result</q> and hence the properties of the points in
that sphere may well necessitate the properties of the point _P_. If the system
obeys a principle of sufficient reason (i.e. nothing happens without a cause and
causes completely determine their effects) then the state of the objects in that
sphere completely determines the state of/at _P_. (For nothing outside that
sphere can have any casual influence of _P_ and by hypothesis the state of _P_
is completely causally determined.) Even if the causal laws are indeterministic
then the probability distribution over the range of _P's_ potential properties
(or whatever it is about _P_ that is causally determined) is casually determined
by the state of things in the relevant sphere. (Though there is a caveat here
which we will discuss when we return to indeterministic causation below.)

==== however does apply at a given point ====
For any specific point in space Russell's argument does apply.
At a given point in space the cause is simultaneous with its effect.
At a given instant, and again given no action at a distance

There can be no gap there nothing outside the point at time t (at a space-like
slice through t) can determine what happens 

Thus causes must be simultaneous with their effects The moment the current
begins to move the magnetic field is generated. The moment the magnetic flux
changes at a point the charged particle at that point begins to accelerate (if
particles are points, otherwise integration over spatial charge distributions
will be involved).

==== a continuous version of no action at a distance ====
These two claims that all universal claims asserting a relationship between the
properties of point instants/objects at point instants 

We hinted above that .

Before limits, continuity, the mathematics of real numbers and of sets of
infinite cardinality were well understood it is easy to see why the prohibition
of (unmediated) action at a distance naturaly led.
was natural to suppose 
The upshot of these considerations is no principles concerning regularities that the laws of any physical system which
is continuous in space and time(/space-time) and has a finite maximum speed of
the propagation of causal influence(:such as the speed of light in special and general relativity:), the laws will never specify what happens
at contiguous instants(/points), since no two distinct instants(/points) are
contiguous.
all true generalities (including causal laws) that concern what happens at
distinct point-times will, like the law of gravitation, specify
relationships/regularities between what happens at points that are some distance
from each other. While for laws that concern a single point at a single instant
(or point masses or if there is some minimum distance below which the finite
speed limit of causation does not apply, then objects below that size) such as
F=ma


For any effect occurring at point P and any sphere/slice of P's past light cone
that is not P itself we may say that the state of the objects/points there is an
intermediate smaller sphere/past light cone slice all of the states of which are
causally

If we had perfect determinism

generalising to probabilistic causation

Anything that is not continuous is mediated through a more proximal cause.

Is this enough for relationships obeying this principle of only mediated action
at a distance to count as causal?

Which to see as foundational <q>defined</q> as the limits of
successively contained sets of causally determining extended spaces (in our
physics these will turn out in hindsight to be roughly concentric sphere). Or
should we view points as given as <q>causal</q> relations as being defined by

Necessitation, appears to have disappeared.

that is sort of the point. That it is all a huge co-incidence that things are
they way they are, is less of a co-incidence that everything being the way it is
*and* there being nomologically necessary laws binding them together.
quote from tractatus here about making things look like they are explained.

Of all the unlovely varieties of necessity (conceptual, epistemic, metaphysical
to name a few) the least lovely is surely nomological necessity. The invocation
of this form of necessity seems to have an unhelpfully pacifying effect. It can
give the sense that there is still some form of necessity That effect would be
warranted if there were some principled and independent way of identifying
causal laws.

In a similar spirit one can identify any number of other forms of necessity, say
cosmological or cabbalistic necessity. Identify some handful of key principles
of the chosen theory, preferably not obviously inconsistent with each other,
and all the sentences that may be derived from them by _absolutely_ necessarily
truth preserving inferences are cosmologically (or what have you) necessary.

The problem exactly parallels Quine's objection to 

Just as he asked (by a liberal standard of indirect quotation) What is it about
these principles that makes them analytic? (quote from Two dogmas????)

The lack of principled criteria for distinguishing.

Indeed Q's point, though it has been so long, was that the move from causal
(or indeed metaphysical) necessity

The problems are not quite the same, solving one does not solve the other. If
one could determine the analytic truths then that would not allow you to
identify causal laws (and hence nomological necessities, mutatis mutandis
for metaphysical necessities.

It is not that causation obeys , but that causal relationships are what define
spatiality. When we talk about the geometry of physical space what we are really
talking about is the proximity/propagation relationships of causation.

When we say that a physical space is three dimensional, what we mean is that the
causal influences . The set of points whose states mediate causal relationships
between two others are between those two points.

==== reduction to causation ====
????
Some might take this as renewed reason to try to identify the causal
relationships. If we could distinguish them then we could perhaps reduce talk of
spatial relationships to

So many of the regularities. It is perhaps to be wondered that our universe does
have a spatial geometry at all.

What then distinguishes the causal relationships. We can conceive of their
failure or at least of a theory containing them being falsified. Two objects,
which despite their gravitational attraction to all the other masses of the
universe, are not attracted to each other. The more abstruse and removed from
observable reality, we may be unsure if they are. But for principles such as say
Buyles law which compares comparably easily observed properties such as pressure
temperature

On the other hand we rely upon them to be true no matter what we do. They are,
as philosophers like to say, support counterfactuals.

But what reason not to settle just for this.

In those cases which we can easily imagine to be a product of human will we can
readily identify the causes.
