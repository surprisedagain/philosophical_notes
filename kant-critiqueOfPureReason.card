=== Three revolutions ===
What do the supposed <q>revolutions</q> in geometry, physics/science and
<q>metaphysics</q> have in common?

==== Geometry ====
    (p.Bxii) The true method [of geometry], so he found, was not to inspect what
    he discovered either in the figure, or in the bare concept of it, and from
    this, as it were, to red of its properties; but to bring out wehat was
    necessarily implied in the concepts he himself had formed _a priori_ and had
    put into the figure in thw construction by which he presented it to himself.
    . . . what necessarily follows from what he has himslef set into it in
    accordance with his concept.
This supposed resemblance between the (newly proposed correct method of)
metaphysics and geometry is the least strained.  Here Kant is hining at
the felt defectiveness of Euclid's Elements  to the
Euclid's elements (in a handful of key points) upon 


==== science ====
(the most tenuous of the three)<br>
    They learned that reason has insight only into that which it produces after
    a plan of its own, and that it must not allow itself to be kept as it were
    in natures leading-strings, but must itself show the way with principles of
    judgement based upon fixed laws, constraining nature to give answer
    questions of reason's own determining.  Accidental observations made in
    obedience to no previously thought out plan can neer be made to yield a
    necessary law  which alone reason is concerned to discover.
    
==== metaphysics ====
(Bxvi)
this is the first mention of the copernican revolution. In what sense is this like the two previous
revolutions in maths and science? ah in both we follow what conforms to what we
put into the figure/experiment

Ah in all cases our reasoning, or at least the production of knowledge by
reason, relies upon sensitivity to what we have <q>put into</q> the subject of
enquiry. The science example is the least plausible. Is it really the claim that
it is in principle impossible to make scientific advances in ethnography or
astronomy where experiment cannot or are not conducted?

We may view it as a method of introducing the <q>copernican revolution</q> in
metaphysics which Kant is championing without placing much, if any, weight upon
it. The claim is: it is plauisble that previous fields of enquiry languished
until we realised that we must focus upon/be sensitive to/

=== division between logic and metaphysics ===
It is well known that Kant's opinions about the prospect of further developments
in logic was completely wrong
    (Bviii) It is remarkable also that to the present day this logic has not
    been able to advance a single step, and is thus to all appearance a closed
    and completed body of doctrine.
The developments of Frege to bring logic
up to the level of complexity required to capture recursively enumerable sets of
sentences as theorems is still 100 years off.

But more importantly Kant offers to explain this completeness as due to logic
being <q>quite precisely delimited; its sole concern is to give an exhaustive
exposition and a strict proof of the formal rules of all thought, whether it be
_a priori_ or empirical</q>.

One wonders what Kant means by <q>formal</q>, surely not the modern view of
rules specified purely in terms of the shapes and sequences of symbols without
reliance unpon their meanings. <q>Strict proof</q> is also somewhat unclear, or
at least foreign to modern logic - how might one _prove_ an axiom of logic,
or offer it any greater cfeedence than it already has? (inference to best
explanation, or because of the fruitfulness of its consequences is urely not
what Kant has in mind.)

metaphysical claims one must suppose, are by contrast those in which the
validity of the reasoning, or the necessity of the claim, depends upon the content
content (i.e. the actual predicate occupying a place) and not merely the form. 
i.e.  logical laws are those that remain valid when a concept is consistently
replaced with another, wheras such substitution can change a metaphysical
necessity into a falsehood.

If this interpretation is correct then logical truths are neither analytic nor
synthetic (unless the notion of containment is stretched enough to include
containment of logical structure, but that seems implausible).

=== causal necessity not distinguished from absolute ===
    (Bxiii) Accidental observations, made in obedience to no previously
    thought-out plan, can never be made to yield a necessary law, which alone
    reason is concerned to discover.

Here we have the ancient refusal to distinguish between causal(/nomological)
necessity and conceptual(/analytic/logical) necessity.
=== hint of argument against idealism ===
Kant repeatedly displays his awareness of the threat of self-contradiction in
asserting that we positively know of the existence of objects about which we can
know nothing.

Why posit noumena? We need a positive reasom. In the introduction the closest we
come is
    (Bxxvi) But our further contention must be duly borne in mind namely that
    though we cannot _know_ these objects as things themselves we must yet be in
    position at least _think_ them as things in themselves; otherwise we should
    be landed in the absurd conclusion they can be appearance without anything
    that appears.

This first hint, at least, is not particularly promising. It seems to hinge
a definitional stop. If these things we experience are not
appearances (and hence have some external/noumenal obejects that they are
appearances of) then let us call them something else. The question then simply
becomes what reason do we have for thinking that our ewxperienfes are
appearances, and to this, as yet, Kant has ventured no answer

== introduction ==
=== a priori ===
Nowhere here is Kant explicit about _a priori_ knowledge being *justified*
without experience. Instead we find talk of <q>independent of experience</q> or
_a posteriori_ knowledge as <q>has its sources _a posteriori_</q> or <q>arises
out of experience</q>. The distinction between the origins, sources or
<q>arising out of</q> is left unclear. If we accept, for the moment, the
justified true belief analysis, one might have knowledge that a subject would
not _believe_ without experience or that would not be justified without
experience. It is the kind of tiring prolixity that makes reading Kant such a
slog.

This potential confusion is exacerbated by Kant's claim that <q>Every
alteration has its cause</q> is _a priori_ but not purely _a priori_ on the
grounds that <q>alteration is a concept which can be derived only from
experience</q>. This <q>derivation</q> suggests that we cannot form the concept
and hence, presumably, not form the judgement <q>Every alteration has its
cause</q> without experience, regardless of whether or not we would have any
justification for believing or disbelieving it. This distinction between _a
priori_ and _a posteriori_ *concepts* is thus far very dubious and we have no
guide apart from this sole example on how to draw it.

Still the very fact that this is distinguished as an impure _a priori_
proposition, goes further to suggest that it is justification that is in
question. It appears that Kant/the translators can be only criticised for lack
of clarity on this point and that on reflection it must be that _a priori_
truths are those of which knowledge can be justified without experience. This is
taken for granted, or as a definitional stipulation, in most modern ENglish
speaking introductions to philosophy and it is merely of interest that it is put
so unclearly in its most influential early exposition.

==== criterion ====
Necessity and certain universality as criterion of _a priority_.

Though counterexamples to these criteria have been constructed with the use of
indexicals, they remain as the touchstone of my own enquiries, even though I
ultimately give up on all three. Certainly, our knowledge of necessity could
never be justified by experience. Is the underlying justification that there is
no necessary connection between distinct existences? That [[hume|Humean]] 
principle reminds me that the more fundamental problem is that experiences are
_caused_ and hence cannot provide evidence for necessity (and are evidence for
possibility only in the sense that they are evidence for the actual and the
actual is always possible).

=== the limits of a priori knowledge ===
One suspects that this is at least partly the scope ofreason - that this lies
behind Kant's claims that pure reason is its own subject matter. That the
proper(?) enquiry of reason is the limits of reason.

First hint of the antimomies concerning God, freedom and immortality.  Here we
also have (for the first time?? hmm introduction, at least clearer/less
metaphorically) the rejection of judgements that <q>go beyond all limits of
experience</q> 

==== analytic/synthetic ====
Analytic: concept expressed by the predicate contained within the
concept expressed by the subject of a sentence.

Not clear if analytic knowledge is one of the
    modes of knowledge [that] leave the field of all possible experiences and
    have the appearance of extending the scope of our judgements beyond all
    limits of experience
It may be that analysis does produce such transcendental knowledge, but that it
is not substantive/ampliative or it may be that analytic knowledge, though
_a priori_ does not extend the scope of our judegements but only appears to. I
lean towards the latter, but the tedious unclarity does not appear to have
significant impact on the rest of the theory. One way or another analytic truths
do not extend our knowledge.


<q>I have merely to analyse the concept, that is, to become conscious to myself
of the manifold which I always think in that concept</q>


For our purposes here analysis does produce _a priori_ knowledge

=== summary ===
It is reasonable to interpret Kant as claiming that _a priori_ knowledge is 
knowledge justified without the aid of experience; and that the two criteria of
such knowledge are necessity and certain universality.

Furthermore a priori knowledge may be distinguished as a analytic




== 2nd book ==
=== chapter 1 ===
    We now come to a concept that was not entered in the above general list of
    the transcendental concepts, and that must yet be classed with them, but
    without in the least changing the table and declaring it deficient. This is
    the concept - or, if one prefers, the judgment I think. But we readily see
    that this concept is the vehicle of all concepts as such and hence also of
    transcendental concepts, and that it is therefore always also comprised
    among these and hence is likewise transcendental.
This is the notion that each sentence <q>P</q> is equivalent to <q>I think P</q>
But these have quite different truth conditions. For P to be true, and for me to
be in a mental state of thinking that P are two quite different things. It may
well be that I think that P and yet P is not true or that P is true and I do not
think it.

Again an extentionalist approach - I is an indexical term whose meanign is fixed
by the pattern of references. If you specify for each token of the word <q>I</q>
what it refers to, there is nothing more to add to the meaning of I. In an
extensionlaist language, as I maintain all languages are, references may be
changed without altering truth value, and holding some variety of
truth-conditional semantics (perhaps psychologised/semanticised) <q>I am
thinking</q> has, said by me, the same meaning as <q>Nathan is thinking</q> and
the latter is not t

The problem in a sense is that I can be certain that I am thinking without
knowing who I am. This prompts the train of confusion that begins by qondering
<q>Who an I?</q> as though there were a sepocial object named by I for each of
us that was somehow essential or perhaps imperceptible to anyone else.

That Kant can have some alternative analysis of _I think . . ._ is fine, but he
doesn't get to use his analysis in his argument for his account, he can't assume
his ananlysis is correct and then derive some further consequence from it.

Still this gives the appearance of being Kant's reply to Descartes - <q>A
science built upon the single proposition '_I think_'</q>. What does he think is
going on here

hmm <q>none but transcendental predicates</q> predicates that must be true or
false of something for it to be possible?

Ah, I see (no joke intended) the word <q>I</q> has a meaning and hence there is
a concept that is what it means/expresses, and on this confusion, we will mount
a pure <q>rational psychology</q> which is the range of consequences of this
claim and other. Ah no - not a concept a <q>bare consciousness which accompanies
all concepts</q>!! How tiresome.

=== chapter 2 ===
antinomies of pure reason
The underlying issue concerns infinity and infinite series:
 * There is no proof of maximal length but each proof is finitely long.
 * There is no ultimate cause but each sequence of causes is finitely long.
   (This is the weakest statement of the problem.)
 * The set of all things that can be reached in a finite number of steps from a
   given starting point may be infinitely large.

=== philosophers dogmatism ===
:todo: link phil dog with Bxv - battleground for those who wish to engage in
mock combat in which not an inch of territory has been gained


=== senses are an epistemic bottleneck ===
    (A293) It is correctly said that the senses do not err; yet not because they
    always judge correctly, but because they do not judge at all
This is the first of the two criteria for an [[epistemic_bottleneck]]
:todo: With the further claim that we only know of the world via
<q>sensibility</q> we would have the second requirement. yes - (Bxvii) <q>the
_experience_ in which alone, as given objects, they can be known</q>

note for later - causality and geometrical space were a projection of our minds
upon the external world. But they were not unchangeable projections.
